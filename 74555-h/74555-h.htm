<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The selections contained in this volume are such as
relate to one subject only—that of country life.
But this, in itself, is a very wide sphere, and offers in
its many different fields, old and new, all the variety
that the most capricious spirit could desire. In collecting
the different passages, the editor has allowed
herself a wide sweep of the net; it has been her aim
to bring together many beautiful passages from the
best writers, mingled with others interesting rather
from their quaintness and oddity, or their antiquity.
With this view, not only have the poets of our own
tongue, ancient and modern, English and American,
been laid under contribution for the reader’s amusement,
but translations from a dozen different languages
have also been included in the volume. Materials
for a work of this nature abound, and the editor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>would have gladly drawn even more largely from the
sources open to her, not only from the older authors,
but from many writers of our own day also. It was
desirable, however, that the volume should not reach
an unwieldy size, as it was intended for pleasant companionship—the
summer-seat, under a shady tree, or
the chimney corner in winter—rather than for the
prouder position allotted to the ponderous quarto on
the library shelf. A word of especial apology is perhaps
needed, regarding some of our omissions; “Comus,”
the “Allegro and Penseroso,” Gray’s “Elegy”
and “Ode to Spring,” with other poems of that class,
though peculiarly fitted for a compilation of this kind,
will not be found in our table of Contents. But they
have already been so often printed and misprinted,
quoted and misquoted!</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The ancient classical writers of the world are thought to
have shown but little sensibility to that natural beauty with
which the earth has been clothed, as with a magnificent garment,
by her Almighty Creator. Those of their works which
have been preserved to us are declared by critics rarely to
bear evidence of much depth of feeling of this kind. The
German scholars are understood to have been the first to
broach this opinion—the first to point out the fact, and to
comment on what appears a singular inconsistency.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If we bear in mind,” says Schiller, “the beautiful scenery
with which the Greeks were surrounded, and remember the
opportunities possessed by a people living in so genial a climate,
of entering into the free enjoyment of the contemplation
of nature, and observe how conformable were their mode of
thought, the bent of their imaginations, and the habits of their
lives to the simplicity of nature, which was so faithfully reflected
in their poetic works, we can not fail to remark with
surprise how few traces are to be met among them of the
sentimental interest with which we in modern times attach
ourselves to the individual characteristics of natural scenery.
The Greek poet is certainly in the highest degree correct,
faithful, and circumstantial in his descriptions of nature, but
his heart has more share in his words than if he were treating
of a garment, a shield, or a suit of armor. Nature seems to
interest his understanding more than his moral perceptions;
he does not cling to her charms with the fervor and the plaintive
passion of the poet of modern times.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>This passage of Schiller, quoted in “Cosmos,” is supported
by similar observations of M. de Humboldt himself: “Specific
descriptions of nature occur only as accessories, for in
Grecian art all things are centered in the sphere of human
life.” And, again: “The description of nature in its manifold
richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature,
was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears
among them merely as the background of the picture, of
which human figures constitute the main subject.” Touches
of description must of course occasionally occur, and whenever
these are found, the harmony of Grecian taste gives them
the highest beauty possible. The many noble similes and comparisons
scattered through the greater poems, form admirable
detached pictures; but they occupy the attention very briefly;
a rapid glance is thrown upon the hill, the river, or the wood,
rather for the purpose of affording greater relief to the figures
in the foreground than of enduing the sketch of these features
of the earth with any charm or importance in itself.
But it is quite impossible to believe for a moment that the
Greeks, so fully alive to the spirit of beauty in all its other
forms, should have been blind to its effects in the natural
world. Other ways of accounting for the apparent inconsistency
must be sought for, and the peculiar character and position
of the people would seem to suggest these. It was quite
consistent with the condition of the world at that early period,
and of the Greeks in particular, that nature and art should not
then hold the same relative places which they occupy to-day.
Art was still in its youth, and of more importance to them than
it is to us. Nature, with all her untold wealth, her unharvested
magnificence, lay before them, close at hand, always
within reach; there was no fear that she should fail them.
But human Art was in its earliest stages of culture; every
successive step was watched with most lively interest; every
progressive movement became of great importance, while
the genius of the Greeks particularly led them to feel extreme
delight in every achievement of the kind. In fact, all
their highest enjoyments flowed from this source, and into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>this sphere they threw themselves with their whole soul.
Whatever susceptibility to the grandeur and beauty of the
inanimate creation was felt among them, sought therefore
rather to express itself in forms more positive than the voice
of song. What, for instance, was the most noble of their
temples but the image in Dorian marble of some grand primeval
grove, whose gray, columnar trunks they found reflected
in the waves of the Ægean Sea? What were the vase, and
the vine wreathed about its lip, but the repetition of living
forms of fruits and foliage growing in the vale of Tempe, or at
the foot of Hymettus? The Greek mind thus beheld the
whole external world chiefly through the medium of human
Art. An interesting and very striking instance of this peculiarity
occurs in the Iliad; no natural object which has a place
in the poem—neither the sea nor the skies, neither the streams
nor the mountains, all glowing as these were with the purple
light of a Grecian atmosphere—could draw from Homer a
description filling half the space allotted by him to the shield
of Achilles; nay, more, observe that where rural life and its
accessories appear the most distinctly in his verse, it is not
the reality which he shows us; we do not ourselves tread the
brown soil of the freshly-tilled fallow; we do not pass along
the one narrow path in the vineyard, amid the purple clusters,
but we are called upon to behold these objects—“sight
to be admired of all!”—as they lie curiously graven by the
hand of Vulcan on the bronze buckler of the hero, where he</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Their very religion was but a work of art, a brilliant web
of the human imagination, into which, as on the metal of
Vulcan, their poets had wrought</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“Borders beauteous, dazzling bright,”</div>

<p class='c008'>where Olympic deities passed to and fro, with grace and spirit
unequaled, but moving ever by the springs of the most common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of human passions. All the inanimate objects of the
visible creation had their allotted places in this gorgeous,
imaginative tissue, though still appearing under associations
purely human. They had, in short, no conceptions of nature
independent of man; to them the whole world was but the
shield of Achilles.</p>

<p class='c012'>With the same mythology, the same philosophy as the
Greeks, the Romans are admitted to have been essentially
plagiarists. They saw the earth, in this sense, with the eyes
of the Greeks. Their literature has even been accused of a
greater dearth of poetical observation, as regards the natural
world, than that of their predecessors. The practical realities
of life engrossed their attention more exclusively. A
colossal selfishness was their striking national characteristic—a
characteristic which was alike the cause, first, of their political
prosperity, and later of their downfall. Rome was their
deity; to her daily needs, or interests, or pleasures, all was
sacrificed; they cared little for the mountains, and forests,
and streams of the earth, provided all the wealth and magnificence
of these were brought over Roman ways to swell the
triumph of the Forum. It has been remarked that Cæsar
could pass the Alps, then comparatively an unknown region,
without one allusion to their sublime character. Still, a body
of men like the great Latin writers could not, of course, exist
devoid of susceptibility to the beauty of the inanimate world,
and many passages may be drawn from their poems bearing
witness to this fact. Although, says M. de Humboldt, there
is no individual rural portraiture in the Æneid, yet “a deep
and intimate comprehension of nature is depicted in soft colors.
Where, for instance, has the gentle play of the waves,
or the stillness of night, been more happily described?” The
modern reader, however, is still left to wonder that poets so
great should not have delighted more frequently in enlarging
upon similar topics, and that even in many of their elegiac
works social life should so exclusively fill up the space.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>should have rather supposed that when the earth stood in her
primitive freshness, in the morning of her existence, her
wealth of beauty as yet unsung, that the works of the first
great poets would have been filled with the simple reflection
of her natural glory. But, as we have seen, such was not
the case with the writers of Greece or of Rome; and, as we
have already ventured to intimate, it would appear that the
great intellectual activity of those races, connected with the
period of time filled by them, where so wide a field opened
in every direction, became in itself a prominent cause of this
peculiar deficiency of their literature. Whatever admiration
they felt for nature expressed itself in positive forms of art, or
in an imaginative system of mythology, rather than in song.</p>

<p class='c012'>But something of a different spirit appears to have actuated
the old Asiatic nations. The ancient Indian races, for instance,
were more contemplative in character, and more vivid
impressions of natural objects are revealed in their writings.
The Sanscrit Hymns, and the heroic poems of the same language,
are said to contain fine descriptive passages. “The
main subject of these writings,” says M. de Humboldt, speaking
of the Sanscrit Vedas, “are the veneration and praise of
Nature.” A poem, called “The Seasons”—and one starts at
the familiar name—with another work, called “The Messenger
of the Clouds,” are full, we are told, of the same spirit;
they were written by Kalidasa, a cotemporary of Virgil
and Horace. It would have given us pleasure to offer the
reader a few fragments from writings so ancient and so interesting;
one would have liked to compare a passage from the
Sanscrit Seasons with those so celebrated and so familiar
from our own language and modern time, but no English versions
are found within reach. The fact, however, of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>characteristic of the Sanscrit poems is placed beyond reasonable
doubt by the declarations of many distinguished men of
learning, more particularly among the German scholars.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chinese, that singular people which for ages have
separated themselves from the rest of the earth by impassable
barriers of prejudice and mystery, are now found—as glimpses
are opening into their interior—to have long shown some partiality
for natural beauty. Among other poems, touching more
or less upon subjects of this kind, they have one bearing the
simple name of “The Garden,” which was written by Seema-kuang,
a celebrated statesman, some eight or nine centuries
since, and which is said to contain agreeable descriptive
passages; the sketch of a hermitage among rocks and evergreen
woods, and a fine, extensive water view over one of
their great rivers, are especially referred to. Lieu-schew,
another ancient writer of theirs, dwells at length on the subject
of pleasure-grounds, for which he gives admirable directions,
in the English style, at a period when a really fine
garden was not to be found in all Northern Europe; a short
translation from a passage of his will be found in the following
selections.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Gardening, in fact, appears to have been the
sphere in which Chinese love of nature has especially sought
to unfold itself; that perception of beauty of coloring and of
nicety of detail, very general among them, shows itself here
in perfection; they have long been great florists, and have
delighted in writing verses upon particular flowers and fruit-trees.
Garden and song were thus closely connected by
them; and if one may judge from brief views received
through others, their poetry has very frequently indeed something
of a horticultural character. Their busy, practical habits
and close inspection of detail would easily incline them
in this direction; but as yet nothing grand or very elevated
has been given to us by translators.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Hebrew poets stand alone. Their position is absolutely
different from that of all profane writers, and places
them at a distance from the usual limits of a mere literary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>comparison. They only, as priests and prophets of the One
Living God, beheld the natural world in the holy light of
truth. Small as was the space the children of Israel filled
among the nations of the earth, the humblest individual of
their tribes knew that the God of Abraham was the Lord God
of Hosts, and that all things visible were but the works of his
hands. “The Lord made the heavens, and the earth, and the
sea, and all that in them is;” they bowed the knee to no one
object “in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the
water under the earth.” Truth is, of its nature, sublime. No
fiction of the human imagination, even in the highest and richest
forms which it is capable of assuming, can approach to
that majesty which is her inherent prerogative. The views
of the earth, open to the children of Israel, had naturally,
therefore, a grandeur far beyond what the Greeks, with all
the luxuriance of their florid mythology, could attain to. Of
this fact—thanks to the translations of the Sacred Writings in
the hands of all who speak the English tongue—any one of us
is capable of judging; the extreme excellence of the Psalms,
merely in the sense of literary compositions, and independently
of the far higher claims they have upon mankind, has
never failed to impress itself deeply on all minds open to such
perceptions. The nineteenth Psalm, with the unequaled
grandeur of its opening verses; the twenty-third, with its
pastoral sweetness; the hundred and fourth, with the fullness
of its natural pictures; the hundred and seventh; the ninety-sixth;
the hundred and forty-fifth; the hundred and forty-eighth,
with others of a similar character, will recur to every
reader. It is generally admitted that, throughout the range of
ancient profane writing, nothing has yet been brought to light
which can equal these, or other great passages of the Psalms,
of the Pentateuch, the Prophets, or the Book of Job. Even
for sweetness, also, the old Hebrew writers were very remarkable.
The most celebrated author and literary artist of
modern Germany, and one little likely to have been influenced
on such a subject by warmth of religious feeling, has
left it as his written opinion that the Book of Ruth, usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>attributed to the prophet Samuel, is “the loveliest specimen
of epic and idyl poetry which we possess.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> But the history
of Jacob and his family, and the personal story of David in all
its details, with other episodes easily pointed out, are almost
equally full of this beautiful pastoral spirit. The same inspired
pens which have dwelt on the grandest events of which
time has any knowledge, have not disdained to move the
lesser chords of human sympathies and affections. It was
the most honored of the Prophets who so nobly recorded the
greatest of all physical facts, the creation of light: “And God
said, Let there be light, and there was light.” And on the
page immediately following, while still occupied in recording
the grand successive stages of the creation, he condescends
to note that out of the earth “the Lord God made to grow
<em>every tree that is pleasant to the sight</em>.” This simple phrase,
taken in connection with all its sublime relations of time and
place, has a gracious tenderness, a compassionate beneficence
of detail which moves the heart deeply; all the delight which
the trees of the wood have afforded to men, independently of
their uses; the many peaceful homes they have overshadowed;
the many eyes they have gladdened; all the festal joys of the
race in which their branches have waved, seem to crowd the
mind in one grateful picture, and force from our lips the familiar
invocation, “O all ye green things upon earth, bless ye
the Lord; praise him, and magnify him forever.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The most ancient writings of the world thus afford evidence
that in those remote ages the perception of natural
beauty was not wanting in the human heart. Different races
and individual men may have varied greatly in giving expression
to the feeling. David and Homer, the Indian and the
Roman, may have sung in very different tones, but wherever
intellectual life was at all active, there some strain, at least,
from the great Hymn was heard.</p>

<p class='c012'>But very early, in what may be called Christian literature,
this feeling began to receive a fresh impulse and a new direction.
On the same soil, and among the same races, where,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>in the height of heathen civilization it had never received
adequate expression, both in Italy and in Greece, the eye of
the believer was gradually opening to clearer and more worthy
views of the creation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look upward,” says St. Chrysostom, “to the vault of
heaven, and around thee on the open fields in which herds
graze by the water-side; who does not despise all the creations
of art, when, in the stillness of his spirit, he watches
with admiration the rising of the sun, as it pours its golden
light over the face of the earth; when, resting on the thick
grass beside the murmuring spring, or beneath the somber
shade of a thick and leafy tree, the eye rests on the far-receding
and hazy distance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Similar passages may also be gathered from the letters of
St. Basil and St. Gregory,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> fathers of the Greek Church.
And still earlier instances of this Christian view of the earth
are quoted from the writings of a Roman lawyer, Minucius
Felix, who lived in the beginning of the third century; his
evening rambles on the shores of the Mediterranean, in the
neighborhood of Ostia, were very feelingly described in pages
which have been preserved to our own time. The Christian
Church possessed a most rich inheritance in the Hebrew literature;
and the constant use of the Psalms of the Temple
in her public services would alone suffice to produce in the
minds of the people a deep impression of the goodness and
majesty of the Divine Creator as revealed in his works. The
Canticle of the Three Children, composed before the foundation
of Rome, and which from the early ages of Christianity
to the present hour has formed a portion of public worship, is
an exalted offering of praise with which we are all familiar:
“O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord, praise him
and magnify him forever!” And in the sublime anthem of
the Te Deum we have another earnest, unceasing expression
of a feeling inseparable from Christianity: “We praise thee,
O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord. Heaven <em>and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>earth</em> are full of the majesty of thy glory!” It is, indeed, revealed
truth only which has opened to the human mind views
of the creation at all worthy of its dignity. It is from her
teaching that we learn to appreciate justly the different works
of the Deity, in their distinctive characters, to allot to each
its own definite position. There is no confusion in her views.
She shows us the earth, and the creatures which people it, in
a clear light. She tells us positively that all things are but
the works of His holy hands—the visible expression of an
Almighty wisdom, and power, and love; and as she speaks,
the idle phantoms of the human imagination, the puerile deities
of the heathen world, the wretched fallacies of presumptuous
philosophy vanish and flee away from the face of the
earth, like the mists and shadows of night at the approach of
the light of day. Not one of the thousand banners of idolatry,
whether unfurled on the mountain-tops, or waving in the
groves, or floating on the streams, but falls before her. She
points out to man his own position, and that of all about him;
he is lord of the earth and of all its creatures. The herb of the
field, the trees of the wood, the fowls of the air, the fishes of
the sea—every living thing that moveth upon earth—all have
been given into his hand—all are subject to his dominion—all
are the gifts of Jehovah.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, ere time had enabled Christian civilization and its ennobling
lessons to make any positive progress, or to produce
any lasting impression on the character of general literature,
the Empire was overwhelmed by races wholly barbarous. A
period of darkness and disorder ensued, during which the very
art of writing seems to have been all but forgotten. A few rude,
unfinished sketches were all that could be expected from such
an age, and in these man himself would naturally engross the
attention. In societies only half civilized, man, as an individual,
must always fill a bolder and more prominent position
than in those where order, and knowledge, and truth are more
widely diffused; he has in such a state of things far greater
power for evil over his fellows; every step becomes of immediate
importance, for it is associated with a thousand perils;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>every turn of private passion, unchecked by vital vigor of law
or religion, may work out a fatal tragedy, and consequently
the individual, either as tyrant, or victim, or champion, excites
unceasing fear and flattery, or pity and commiseration,
or gratitude and admiration. Wild legends, now warlike, now
religious in spirit, naturally belonged to those centuries. No
doubt the birds of heaven sang, and the flowers of the field
bloomed in those ages; but we have scanty record of their existence;
the eye of man was fixed on darker objects; his ear
was filled with fiercer sounds.</p>

<p class='c012'>Slowly, however, civilization and social order—those natural
accessories of the Christian faith—were making progress;
but the most striking efforts of reviving intelligence at
this period did not assume the shape of letters. That latent
poetical spirit, never wholly extinct in the human heart,
sought for development during those ages through other channels.
Under the hand of the religious architect, pious, though
lamentably superstitious, the dignity of the forest was once
more embodied in novel and imposing labors of art; scarce a
fine effect of the branching woods which was not successfully
repeated with great richness of detail in Gothic stone. The
beauty of the vegetation, in its noblest forms, must have been
deeply impressed on the hearts of the men who, with Teutonic
patience, raised those magnificent piles. Every American
familiar with the beautiful and varied effects of old forests
of blended growth, where fir and pine cross their evergreen
branches amid the lighter tracery of deciduous trees, may
have often noted some single fir, rising tall and spire-like far
above the lesser grove, into the light of sun and star; some
similar evergreen, rooted in the soil of Europe, was doubtless
the original of that most beautiful of Christian architectural
forms, the church spire of the Middle Ages:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>It was about the time when those mediæval churches were
rising from the towns of central Europe—slow in their stately
growth as the forest whence their forms were drawn—that
Troubadour and Trouvère, Minstrel and Minnesinger, began
their wanderings in the same region; and amid the strange
medley of human passion and religious superstition to which
they gave utterance, some strains of great natural sweetness
were heard. It was then that the returning cuckoo was greeted
in England with song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sumer is ycumen in,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lhude sing cuccu!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was then that merle and mavis, nightingale and lark, were
saluted with responsive music by the listening poet; it was
then that daisy and lily, <em>la douce Marguerite</em> and the <em>Flower
of Light</em>, were so fondly cherished and so highly honored;
it was then that the May-pole was raised in the castle court
and on the village green, and that high and low, like Arcite,
hurried afield on May-day morning “for to fetch some
grene.” It was then, in short, that the blossoms and the
fowls of Europe were first sung in the modern dialects of the
people.</p>

<p class='c012'>Those old wandering minstrels, troubadour and minnesinger,
were, in fact, the heralds of reviving letters; they struck
the first sparks of national, indigenous literary feeling in its modern
forms. It was from them that Petrarch and Dante learned
to speak the language of the living, rather than that of the
dead. It was from their example that those great poets took,
what was then a very daring step, and, rejecting the Latin,
chose their native language as a medium of compositions of
the highest order. How they succeeded, the whole world
knows; and among the writings of those great Italian masters
there are very beautiful descriptive passages, a few of which,
in the form of translations, may be found in the later pages of
this volume.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Fortunately for all who speak the English tongue, Chaucer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“the morning star” of British verse, as he has been
hailed by Denham, followed in the track of the Italian poets;
the fountains of his inspiration flowed fresh and full from his
native soil. How keenly alive was he to every detail of natural
beauty in the green fields of England; to the sweetness
and freshness of the opening daisy; of the growing grass;
of the unfolding leaf, with its “glad, light green!” He was
followed by others with the same happy instincts, and a love
of nature was thus infused into the earliest literature of our
language. All the great poets of the sixteenth, and those of
the best years of the seventeenth centuries, were more or less
under the influence of this spirit—Shakspeare, Jonson, Spenser,
Drayton, the Fletchers, Milton, Cowley, Denham, Dryden,
Walker, Herbert, Herrick. How long is the noble roll
of names of that period, who have all contributed something
to our wealth in this way! There came a moment, however,
when a colder and more artificial style acquired in England
the same influence which long proved so paralyzing in France,
when poets were content to copy those who had preceded
them; when they trod the London pavement and the coffeehouse
floors much more frequently than the narrow paths
about the fields. Mr. Wordsworth has remarked, that during
a period of sixty years, between the publication of “Paradise
Lost” and that of the “Seasons,” all the poetry of England, with
the exception of a passage or two, does not contain “a single
new image of external nature.” Poets were courtiers in
those times, or they aimed at becoming so; they prided
themselves upon a neatly turned compliment, upon a farfetched
dedication; they were wits—they were pretty fellows
about town; like Horace Walpole’s lively old friend, Madame
du Deffand, they could very conscientiously avow, “<i><span lang="fr">Je n’aime
pas les plaisirs innocents!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Wordsworth dates the dawn of the modern era in poetry
from the appearance of the “Seasons,” which were first
published in the year 1726. A single great work will no doubt
often produce surprisingly general effects in the literary
world, when the atmosphere is prepared for it. And such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>was the case when Thomson wrote. Many different influences
were gradually combining to work out the same result.
A high degree of general education, in connection with the
prevalence of Christian religious truth, must always naturally
dispose the mind to a more just appreciation of the works of
the Deity, as compared with the works of man. The wider
our views of each, the higher will be our admiration of the
first. We say general civilization, however; for where the
advantages of education are confined to a small class, that
class will usually be found only in the large towns of a country,
and its tastes and habits will therefore necessarily be
more or less artificial. The rustic population, in such a state
of things, will be rude, coarse, and deemed only fit for ridicule
and burlesque. The poet of such a period has no sooner
tried his strength, than he is eager to turn his back on the
fields; he hurries “to town,” to the center of all enlightenment,
and soon becomes metamorphosed into a cockney or a
courtier. In their day Paris and London have probably
thus swallowed up many a man of genius, country born and
country bred, who, had he remained in his native haunts,
could never have failed in real honest feeling for that natural
beauty which, like the mercy of God, is new every morning.
Had Cowper lived all his days in Bond Street he never could
have written the “Task.” Conceive a man like Crabbe, or
Burns, transported for life to Grub Street, and imagine what
would be the inevitable effects of the change on a spirit like
theirs. But a general diffusion of civilization produces an
entirely different state of things. An intellectual man may
now live most of his days in the country without disgrace
and without annoyance. He may read and he may write
there with pleasure and with impunity. A wide horizon for
observation opens about him to-day in the fields, as elsewhere.
Science, commerce, painting, sculpture, horticulture—all
the higher arts, in fact—are so many noble laborers
hourly toiling for his benefit, as well as for that of the townsman.
General education is also daily enlarging the public
audience, and thus giving more healthful play to diversity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>tastes. No single literary class is likely, in such a state of
things, to usurp undue authority over others—to impose academical
fetters on even the humblest of its cotemporaries.
Whatever is really natural and really worthy, may therefore
hope in the end for a share of success. But we conceive
that it would still be possible for all these circumstances to
unite in favoring the literature of the age, without leading it
into those views of the natural world which have so decidedly
marked its course in our own day, without producing at
least results so striking, a change so marked. It is, we believe,
the union of Christianity with this general diffusion of
a high degree of civilization which has led us to a more
deeply felt appreciation of the works of the creation. It has
always been from lands blessed with the light of revealed truth
that the choir of praise has risen with the greatest fullness.
And it would be easy, also, to prove that those individual
writers who have sung the natural beauty of the earth with
the greatest fervor of feeling and truth of description have
been more or less actuated by a religious spirit. Take as
examples the poets of our own language; how many of those
who have touched upon similar subjects were moved by what
may be called Christian impulses? Go back as far even as
Chaucer and Dunbar, Shakspeare and Spenser, Milton and
Fletcher; if these were not all what is called religious men,
yet the writings of even Chaucer and Shakspeare, though
tainted with the grossness of their times, were the works of
believing Christian hearts. If we look nearer to our own
day, from the period of Thomson and Dyer to the present
hour, the fact is self-evident, and needs no repetition of
names. There have been instances, no doubt, among the
greater English poets of the last fifty years, where success in
natural description has been combined with an avowed or implied
religious skepticism. But no man can be born and bred
in a Christian community, taught in its schools, governed by
its laws, educated by its literature, without unconsciously,
and, as it were, in spite of himself, imbibing many influences
of the prevailing faith. Even the greatest English poets of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the skeptical school are forced to resort to what appears to
the reader a combination of an imperfect, enfeebled Christianity
with an incomplete and lifeless Paganism. Their
views of the material world almost invariably assume a
Greek aspect; and we must adhere to the opinion, that, in
spite of their florid character, their grace of outline, their
richness of detail, these fall unspeakably, immeasurably short
of the grandeur, the healthful purity, the living beauty, the
power and tenderness of feeling which belong to revealed
truth. With the Greek, as with so many others, man was,
more or less palpably, the great center of all. Not so with
the Christian; while Revelation allots to him a position elevated
and ennobling, she also reads him the lowliest lessons.
No system connects man by more close and endearing ties,
with the earth and all its holds, than Christianity, which
leaves nothing to chance, nothing to that most gloomy and
most impossible of chimeras, fate, but refers all to Providence,
to the omniscient wisdom of a God who is love; but at the
same time she warns him that he is himself but the steward
and priest of the Almighty Father, responsible for the use of
every gift; she plainly proclaims the fact, that even here on
earth, within his own domains, his position is subordinate.
The highest relation of every created object is that which
connects it with its Maker: “For thy pleasure they are, and
were created!” This sublime truth Christianity proclaims
to us, and there is breadth enough in this single point to
make up much of the wide difference between the Christian
and the heathen poet. And which of these two views is the
most ennobling, each of us may easily decide for himself.
Look at the simple flower of the field; behold it blooming at
the gracious call of the Almighty, beaming with the light of
heavenly mercy, fragrant with the holy blessing, and say if
it be not thus more noble to the eye of reason, dearer to the
heart, than when fancy dyed its petals with the blood of a
fabled Adonis or Hyacinthus? Go out and climb the highest
of all the Alps, or stand beside the trackless, ever-moving sea,
or look over the broad, unpeopled prairie, and tell us whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>it is that the human spirit is so deeply moved by the spectacle
which is there unfolded to its view. Go out at night—stand
uncovered beneath the star-lit heavens, and acknowledge the
meaning of the silence which has closed your lips. Is it not
an overpowering, heartfelt, individual humility, blended with
an instinctive adoration or acknowledgment in every faculty
of the holy majesty of the One Living God, in whom we live,
and move, and have our being? And where, at such a moment,
are all the gods with which Homer peopled his narrow
world? An additional sense of humiliation for the race to
which we belong, and which could so long endure fallacies
so puerile, weighs on the spirit at the question, and with a
greater than Homer we exclaim: “O worship the Lord in
the beauty of holiness; let all the earth stand in awe of
Him!”</p>

<p class='c012'>A distinguished living poet of England, Mr. Keble, has a
very pleasing theory in connection with this subject. In his
view, the three great divisions of poetry belong naturally to three
successive periods of the world: the epic flows from the heroic
youth of a race; the drama, with its varied scenes and rival
interests, from the ambitious maturity of middle age; while,
as civilization advances farther in the cycle of time, the human
heart oppressed with the strife of passion, the eye
wearied with the restless pageant of vanity, turn instinctively
to more simple and more healthful sources of enjoyment, and
seeking refreshment from the sweetness and beauty of the natural
world, give expression to the feeling in the poetry of
rural life. In this sense the verse of the fields—the rural
hymn—becomes the last form of song, instead of being the
first. Something similar to this has doubtless often been the
course of individual life; many of the greatest minds and best
hearts of our race have successively gone through these different
stages—the aspiring dream of youthful enthusiasm,
the struggle in the crowded arena of life, and the placid calm
of thoughtful repose and voluntary retirement under the shade
of the vine and the fig-tree. Happy will it be for the civilized
world, for these latter ages of the earth, if such should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>indeed prove the general course of the race! Most happy
will it be for us, the latest born of the nations, we who belong
to the aged times of the world, if such should be our own
direction!</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably there never was a people needing more than ourselves
all the refreshments, all the solace, to be derived from
country life in its better forms. The period at which we have
arrived is rife with high excitement; the fever of commercial
speculations, the agitation of political passions, the mental exertion
required by the rapid progress of science, by the ever-recurring
controversies of philosophy, and, above all, that spirit
of personal ambition and emulation so wearing upon the individual,
and yet so very common in America, all unite to produce
a combination of circumstances rendering it very desirable
that we should turn, as frequently as possible, into paths
of a more quiet and peaceful character. We need repose of
mind. We need the shade of the trees and the play of
healthful breezes to refresh our heated brow. We need the
cup of water, pure from the spring, to cool our parched lips;
we need the flowers, to soothe without flattery; the birds, to
cheer without excitement; we need the view of the green
turf, to teach us the humility of the grave; and we need the
view of the open heavens, to tell us where all human hopes
should center.</p>

<p class='c012'>Happily, in spite of the eagerness with which our people
throw themselves upon every rallying point of excitement, they
are by no means wanting in feeling for a country life. It is
true they delight in building up towns; but still, a large portion
of those who have a choice look forward to some future
day when a country roof shall cover their heads. They
hurry to the cities to grow rich; but very many take pleasure
in returning at a later hour to their native village, or at least
put up a suburban cottage, with a garden and grass-plat of
their own. The rural aspect which has been given to our
villages and smaller country towns, and which is often preserved
with some pains—the space between the buildings,
the trees lining the streets and shading every wall, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>little door-yard of flowers—all these are evidences of healthful
instincts. But another, and very striking proof of the existence
of the love of nature in our people may be found in the
character of American verse. A very large proportion of the
poetical writing of the country partakes of this spirit; how
many noble passages, how many pleasing lines, will immediately
recur to the mind as the remark suggests itself; scarce
a poet of note among us who has not contributed largely to
our national riches in this way; and one often meets, in some
village paper or inferior magazine, with very pleasing verses
of this kind, from pens quite unknown. Probably if an experienced
critic were called upon to point out some general
characteristic of American poetry, more marked than any
other, he would, without hesitation, declare it to be a deeply-felt
appreciation of the beauty of the natural world.</p>

<p class='c012'>But although as a people we have given ample evidence of
an instinctive love of nature, yet we have only made a beginning
in these pleasant paths. There still remains much for us to
do. This natural taste, like all others, is capable of much
healthful cultivation; it would be easy to name many steps by
which, both as individuals and as communities, it lies in our
power to advance the national progress in this course; but to
do so would carry us beyond the limits allotted to our present
task. It is hoped, however, that we may be forgiven for detaining
the reader a moment longer, while we allude at least
to one view of the subject which is not altogether without importance.
The social condition of Christendom has, in many
respects, very materially changed within the last fifty years.
Town and country no longer fill what for ages seemed the unalterable
relative position of each. A countryman is no longer
inevitably a boor, nor a townsman necessarily a cockney;
all have, in their turn, trod the pavement and the green turf.
This is especially the case in America; the life, the movement
in which our people delight, is constantly bringing all
classes into contact, one with another, and diffusing the same
influences throughout the entire population. Something of
that individuality which gives interest and variety to the face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of society is lost in this way; but, on the other hand, we gain
many facilities for general improvement by these means. The
interchange between town and country has become rapid,
ceaseless, regular, as the returns of dawn and dusk. But yet,
in spite of the unbroken communication, the perpetual intermingling,
there still remains to each a distinctive, inalienable
character; the moving spirit of the town must always continue
artificial, while that of the country is, by a happy necessity,
more natural. We believe that the moment has come
when American civilization may assume, in this respect, a
new aspect. The wonderful increase of commercial and
manufacturing luxury, which is characteristic of the age,
must inevitably produce a degree of excess in the cities;
all the follies of idle ostentation and extravagant expenditure
will, as a matter of course, flourish in such an atmosphere,
until, as they expand right and left, they overshadow many
things of healthier growth, and give a false glare of coloring
to the whole society which fosters them. There are many
reasons why our own towns are especially in danger from this
state of things; they have no Past; they lack Experience;
Time for them has no individual teachings beyond those of
yesterday; there are no grave monuments of former generations
standing in the solemn silence of a thousand warning
years along their streets.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_040.jpg' alt='[Pastoral Scene]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Probably there never has been a social condition in which
the present is more absolutely absorbing, more encroaching,
in fact, than in our American towns. The same influences
may extend into the country; but it is impossible for them to
be equally powerful in the open fields, where they are weakened
by the want of concentration, and by many counteracting
circumstances. The situation of the countryman is in
this sense favorable; he is surrounded by great natural teachers,
by noble monitors, in the works of the Deity; many are
the salutary lessons to be learned on the mountain-tops, within
the old groves beside the flowing stream. The everlasting
hills—the ancient woods—these are his monuments—these
tell him of the past, and not a seed drops from his hand but
prophesies of the future. The influences which surround
the countryman are essentially ennobling, elevating, civilizing,
in fact. Strange as the remark might have appeared a
hundred years ago, we shall venture deliberately to repeat it
at the present hour: We conceive that the spirit which pervades
country life to-day, to be more truly civilizing in its nature
than that which glitters in our towns. All that is really
desirable of the facilities of life may now be readily procured
in the fields, while the excesses of luxury and frivolous fashion
are more easily avoided there. Many different elements
are blended in the composition of true elegance, and some of
these are of a very homely, substantial nature; plain common
sense, and even a vein of sterner wisdom are requisite; that
moderation which avoids excess is absolutely indispensable;
order and harmony of combination are needed; dignity and
self-respect are essentials; natural feeling must be there,
with all its graceful shades of deference and consideration for
the rights and tastes of others; intellectual strength, which
has no sympathy with the merely vapid and frivolous, is a
matter of course; and while cheerfulness and gayety, easy
and unforced as the summer breezes, should not fail, yet a
spirit of repose is equally desirable; it is evident, also, that a
healthful moral tone is requisite, since, where this is wanting,
the semblance of it is invariably assumed; and to all these
must be added that high finish of culture which years and reflection
can alone give. What element is there among these
which may not be readily fostered in country life? On the
other hand, that very concentration which was formerly so
favorable to the progress of the towns, is now producing injurious
effects by leading to excesses, and perversion of
healthful tastes. The horizon of the townsman becomes fictitiously
narrowed; he needs a wider field for observation—greater
space for movement—more leisure for reflection. He
learns to attach too much importance by far to the trappings of
life; he has forgotten, in short, the old adage: “<i><span lang="fr">Non è l’abito
che fà il monaco!</span></i>” It can scarcely, therefore, be an error
of judgment to believe that while in past generations the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>country has received all its wisdom from the town, the moment
has come when in American society many of the higher
influences of civilization may rather be sought in the fields,
when we may learn there many valuable lessons of life, and
particularly all the happy lessons of simplicity.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>This charming fairy tale of Chaucer has never yet, it is
believed, been reprinted entire in America. The poem,
complete, in its quaint, original garb, has been placed among
these selections with the hope that its intrinsic beauty and its
rarity may alike prove sources of interest to the reader. Unfortunately
there is much of Chaucer which will not bear to
be generally read—much against which we are justly cautioned.
But the grossness with which he is reproached must
have been rather the fault of the age to which he belonged,
than of the man himself, for the passages open to us are full
of sweetness and delicacy, so fresh and original, so quaintly
fanciful, so altogether delightful, that one can never cease to
deplore that all his pages should not be equally fair and clean.
Here, however, we have a complete work of the old master
quite free from objection; in this instance the delicacy of the
fancy appears to have shielded him from the prevailing coarseness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of the period in which he wrote. The uncouth old spelling
need not deprive any one of the pleasure of enjoying the
poem, as a few minutes’ practice will accustom the eye and
the ear to the strangeness of the orthography and rhythm. It
would have been very easy to obviate those last obstacles entirely
by giving the reader Dryden’s version, instead of the
original; but there are a thousand charming touches in Chaucer
quite peculiar to himself, and which Dryden, with all his
higher polish, could never really improve. Every original
work of a man of genius, even when imperfect and faulty,
must always possess a life and reality which no imitation,
even the most finished, can hope to equal; and in this, as in
every other instance, we have preferred carrying our bucket
to the fountain head. Let us hope the reader will enjoy the
draught offered to him from</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>II.<br> <span class='blackletter'>The Bee.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“A bee among the flowers in spring is one of the cheerfullest
things that can be looked upon. Its life appears to be
all enjoyment: so busy, and so pleased.” Any one who has
wandered about the fields during the warmer months will assuredly
agree with this opinion of Paley. The very hum of
the bee, as it flies past us on its pleasant errand, in quest of
some sweet flower, or returning with its dainty load, is one
of the most cheery of the voices of summer. The movement
of the little creature, also, is full of meaning, and attracts the
eye as curiously characteristic of its nature; it generally flies
in lines more or less direct; we see here nothing of the idle,
roaming, vagrant flutter of the gaudy butterfly, and nothing
of the doubtful, hesitating, over-cautious pause of the plodding
ant. The instincts of the bee are all lively and vigorous; it
seems conscious that wherever grass grows, there some blossom
will be found to reward its search, and it moves steadily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>onward until a head of clover, or perchance a prouder flower,
offers the precious drop. And, alighting to gather its grateful
harvest, how skillfully its work is carried on; other insects
may show as much cleverness in attaining their end, but there
are few indeed which accomplish their task so pleasantly.
The wise little bee does no mischief; no violence marks her
labors; the freshness of the flower remains unsullied by her
passage; she leaves the gay petals and the green foliage alike
uninjured; no plant suffers from her visits! There is nothing
unsightly, nothing repelling or painful in any of her measures;
all is order, nicety, and harmony. If we may believe Milton,
to watch the bee at her task was a pleasure worthy of Paradise.
Adam, when he awakens Eve, invites her to prune her
vines, to prop her flowers, and to mark</p>

      <div class='line in5'>.  .  .  .  “How the bee</div>
      <div class='line'>Sits on the bloom, extracting liquid sweets.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>As a poetical accessory of rural life, the bee was much
honored by the ancient writers, receiving at their hands far
more notice than has fallen to her share in later times. The
reader is already aware that the Fourth Georgic of Virgil,
relating wholly to bees, takes the first rank among the most
beautiful and perfect of Latin poems. Extracts from Sotheby’s
translations of this Georgic are given among the following Selections.
It is amusing to note some of the errors and misconceptions
of the master regarding the habits of those little
creatures; and yet it is generally admitted, that from the great
attention paid to them, the ancients had more correct notions
regarding the bee than on any other subject of natural history.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Phys.</em> *  *  * Let me now call your attention to that Michaelmas
daisy. A few minutes ago, before the sun sunk behind the hill, its
flowers were covered with varieties of bees, and some wasps, all busy in
feeding on its sweets. I never saw a more animated scene of insect
enjoyment. The bees were most of them humble-bees, but many of them
new varieties to me, and the wasps appeared different from any I have
seen before.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Hal.</em> I believe this is one of the last autumnal flowers that insects of
this kind haunt. In sunny days it is their constant point of resort, and
it would afford a good opportunity to the entomologist to make a collection
of British bees.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Poict.</em> I neither hear the hum of the bee, nor can I see any on its
flowers. They are now deserted.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Phys.</em> Since the sun has disappeared, the cool of the evening has, I
suppose, driven the little winged plunderers to their homes; but see!
there are two or three humble-bees which seem languid with the cold,
and yet they have their tongues still in the fountain of honey. I believe
one of them is actually dead, yet his mouth is still attached to the flower.
He has fallen asleep, and probably died while making his last meal of
ambrosia.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Giles Fletcher is one of the old English poets but
little known to the general reader in America. And yet
he was the author of a poem of high merit. He was born
about twenty years after Shakspeare, or in 1588, and came
of a family marked by great poetical talent. John Fletcher,
the celebrated dramatist and fellow-laborer of Beaumont, was
a cousin, and it was his elder brother, Phineas Fletcher, who
wrote “The Purple Island,” that singular and elaborate poetical
allegory, carried out through twelve cantos, and relieved
by much occasional beauty of thought and style. The father
also, Dr. Giles Fletcher, has been ranked among the good
poets of his day. The only work of Giles Fletcher, the son,
which has been published, is of a religious character, “Christ’s
Victory and Triumph,” a poem in four parts. It has never
been reprinted entire in America, though full of fine passages,
and marked throughout with originality and beauty. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>subjects are of course very much of the same nature as those
of “Paradise Regained;” a comparison of the two poems,
however, by no means diminishes our admiration for the work
of Fletcher, especially when we bear in mind that he wrote
half a century before Milton. In fact, “Christ’s Victory and
Triumph” was, at the time it appeared, the finest sacred poem
of any length in our language; it is full of a jubilant poetical
eloquence and the earnest expression of strong religious
feeling connected with the subject. Giles Fetcher, like his
brother Phineas, was a clergyman of the Church of England,
and led an uneventful life in his country parish of Alderton,
Suffolk, where he died in 1623.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>V.<br> <span class='blackletter'>Lark and Nightingale.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The voices of these two noblest of the singing-birds of the
Old World may be heard, in echoing accompaniment,
throughout the prolonged choir of European poets, from the
earliest dawn of civilization to the present hour. There are
few poems of any length, in either of the languages of Europe,
in which some allusion to one or the other has not a
place. The noblest poets of the earth were born companions
to these birds; beneath skies saluted by the lark, among groves
haunted by the nightingale. These little creatures sung with
Homer and Sappho among the isles of Greece—for Virgil and
Horace on the plains of Italy; they cheered Dante in his lifelong
wandering exile, and Petrarch in his solitary hermitage.
Conceive also the joy with which Chaucer, and Shakspeare,
and Spenser listened, each in his day, among the daisied
fields of England, to music untaught, instinctive like their
own! What pure delight, indeed, have these birds not given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to the heart of genius during thousands of springs and summers!
How many generations have they not charmed with
their undying melodies! They would almost seem by their
sweetness to have soothed the inexorable powers of Time
and Death. Were an old Greek or an ancient Roman to
rise from the dust this summer’s day—were he to awaken,
after ages of sleep, to walk his native soil again, scarce an
object on which his eye fell would wear a familiar aspect;
scarce a sound which struck his ear but would vibrate there
most strangely; yet with the dawn, rising from the plain of
Marathon, or the Latin Hills, he would hear the same noble
lark which sung in his boyhood; and with the moon, among
the olives and ilexes shading the fallen temple, would come
the same sweet nightingale which entranced his youth.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE NOTE OF THE NIGHTINGALE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>A LETTER OF CHARLES JAMES FOX.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Dear Grey</span>—In defense of my opinion about the nightingales, I find
Chaucer—who of all poets seems to have been the fondest of the singing
of birds—calls it a merry note; and though Theocritus mentions nightingales
six or seven times, he never mentions their note as plaintive or
melancholy. It is true he does not call it anywhere merry, as Chaucer
does, but by mentioning it with the song of the blackbird, and as answering
it, he seems to imply that it was a cheerful note. Sophocles is
against us; but he says, “<em>lamenting Itys</em>,” and the comparison of her
to Electra is rather as to perseverance, day and night, than as to sorrow.
At all events, a tragic poet is not half so good authority in this
question as Theocritus and Chaucer. I can not light upon the passage
in the “Odyssey,” where Penelope’s restlessness is compared to the nightingale,
but I am sure it is only as to restlessness that he makes the comparison.
If you will read the last twelve books of the “Odyssey” you will
certainly find it, and I am sure you will be paid for your hunt, whether
you find it or not. The passage in Chaucer is in the “Flower and Leaf.”
The one I particularly allude to in Theocritus is in his “Epigrams,” I
think in the fourth. Dryden has transferred the word <em>merry</em> to the
goldfinch, in the “Flower and the Leaf”—in deference, may be, to the
vulgar error. But pray read his description of the nightingale there;
it is quite delightful. I am afraid that I like these researches as much
better than those that relate to Shaftesbury and Sunderland, as I do
those better than attending the House of Commons.</p>

      <div class='line'>Many a nightingale perched giddily</div>
      <div class='line'>On blossoming twig still swinging from the breeze,</div>

      <div class='line'>And I saw the rustic still</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Up this green woodland side let’s softly rove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And list the nightingale; she dwells just here.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hush! let the wood-gate softly clap, for fear</div>
      <div class='line'>The noise might drive her from her home of love;</div>
      <div class='line'>For here I’ve heard her many a merry year—</div>
      <div class='line'>At morn, at eve—nay, all the live-long day,</div>
      <div class='line'>As though she lived on song. This very spot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just where the old-man’s-beard all wildly trails</div>
      <div class='line'>Rude arbors o’er the road, and stops the way;</div>
      <div class='line'>And where the child its blue-bell flowers hath got,</div>
      <div class='line'>Laughing and creeping through the mossy rails;</div>
      <div class='line'>There have I hunted like a very boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Creeping on hands and knees through matted thorn,</div>
      <div class='line'>To find her nest, and see her feed her young,</div>
      <div class='line'>And vainly did I many hours employ:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>All seemed as hidden as a thought unborn;</div>
      <div class='line'>And where those crumpling fern-leaves ramp among</div>
      <div class='line'>The hazel’s under-boughs, I’ve nestled down</div>
      <div class='line'>And watch’d her while she sang; and her renown</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath made me marvel that so famed a bird</div>
      <div class='line'>Should have no better dress than russet brown.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her wings would tremble in her ecstasy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feathers stand on end, as ’twere with joy;</div>
      <div class='line'>And mouth wide open to release her heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Of its out-sobbing songs. The happiest part</div>
      <div class='line'>Of summer’s fame she shared, for so to me</div>
      <div class='line'>Did happy fancy shapen her employ.</div>
      <div class='line'>But if I touched a bush, or scarcely stirred,</div>
      <div class='line'>All in a moment stopt. I watched in vain:</div>
      <div class='line'>The timid bird had left the hazel bush,</div>
      <div class='line'>And oft in distance hid to sing again.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost in a wilderness of listening leaves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rich ecstasy would pour its luscious strain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till envy spurred the emulating thrush</div>
      <div class='line'>To start less wild and scarce inferior songs;</div>
      <div class='line'>For while of half the year care him bereaves,</div>
      <div class='line'>To damp the ardor of his speckled breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>The nightingale to summer’s life belongs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And naked trees, and winter’s nipping wrongs</div>
      <div class='line'>Are strangers to her music, and her rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her joys are ever green—her world is wide!</div>
      <div class='line'>Hark! there she is, as usual; let’s be hush;</div>
      <div class='line'>For in this black-thorn clump, if rightly guessed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her curious house is hidden. Part aside</div>
      <div class='line'>Those hazel branches in a gentle way,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stoop right cautious 'neath the rustling boughs,</div>
      <div class='line'>For we will have another search to-day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hunt this fern-strewn thorn-clump round and round;</div>
      <div class='line'>And where this reeded wood-grass idly bows,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll wade right through; it is a likely nook.</div>
      <div class='line'>In such like spots, and often on the ground</div>
      <div class='line'>They’ll build, where rude boys never think to look.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ay! as I live! her secret nest is here,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon this white-thorn stump!&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</div>
      <div class='line'>We will not plunder music of its dower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor turn this spot of happiness to thrall,</div>
      <div class='line'>For melody seems hid in every flower</div>
      <div class='line'>That blossoms near thy home. These blue-bells all</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem bowing with the beautiful in song;</div>
      <div class='line'>And gaping cuckoo-flower, with spotted leaves,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Seems blushing of the singing it has heard.</div>
      <div class='line'>How curious is the nest! No other bird</div>
      <div class='line'>Uses such loose materials, or weaves</div>
      <div class='line'>Its dwelling in such spots! Dead oaken leaves</div>
      <div class='line'>Are placed without, and velvet moss within;</div>
      <div class='line'>And little scraps of grass, and scant and spare,</div>
      <div class='line'>What hardly seem materials, down and hair;</div>
      <div class='line'>For from men’s haunts she nothing seems to win.</div>

<h3 class='c014'>FROM THE “COMPLETE ANGLER.”</h3>

<p class='c019'>At first the lark, when she means to rejoice, to cheer herself and
those that hear her, she then quits the earth, and sings as she ascends
higher into the air; and having ended her heavenly employment, grows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>then mute and sad, to think she must descend to the dull earth, which
she would not touch but for necessity,</p>

<p class='c012'>How do the blackbird and throssel, with their melodious voices, bid
welcome to the cheerful spring, and in their fixed mouths warble forth
such ditties as no art or instrument can reach to!</p>

<p class='c012'>Nay, the smaller birds also do the like in their particular seasons, as,
namely, the laverock, the titlark, the little linnet, and the honest robin,
that loves mankind, both alive and dead.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the nightingale—another of my airy creatures—breathes such
sweet, loud music out of her little instrumental throat, that it might
make mankind to think miracles are not ceased. He that at midnight,
when the very laborer sleeps securely, should hear—as I have very
often—the clear airs, the sweet descants, the natural rising and falling,
the doubling and redoubling of her voice, might well be lifted above
earth, and say, “Lord, what music hast thou provided for the saints in
heaven, when thou afforded bad men such music on earth?”</p>

upward, sing as he rises, and hopes to get to heaven, and climb above
the clouds; but the poor bird was beaten back with the loud sighings of
an eastern wind, and his motion made irregular and inconstant, descending
more and more at every breath of the tempest than it could
recover by the libration and frequent weighing of his wings; till the
little creature was forced to sit down and pant, and stay till the storm
was over, and then it made a prosperous flight, and did rise and sing, as
if it had learned music and motion from an angel, as he passed sometimes
through the air about his ministries here below: so is the prayer
of a good man.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>What, alas! will become of those luckless wights—the
future poets of Caffreland and New Zealand, of Patagonia
and Pitcairn’s Island—when they suddenly awake to the
miserable reality that there is no May in their year. May!
The very word in itself is charming; pleasing to the eye,
falling sweetly on the ear, gliding naturally into music and
song, dowered with innumerable images of beauty and delight,
imaginary bliss, and natural joy. What, we ask again,
will be the melancholy consequences to the southern hemisphere
when they become fully conscious that they have lost
the “merry month,” the “soote season,” from their calendar—that
with them January must forever linger in the lap of
May. Conceive of Hottentot elegies and Fejee sonnets enlarging
upon the balmy airs and soft skies of November;
raving about the tender young blossoms of December, and the
delicate fruits of January. Will the world ever become really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>accustomed to such a change of key? We doubt it. After
all, there is something in primogeniture; it naturally gives all
the honors of precedence. Those writers who first caught the
ear of the listening earth will always have the best of it; their
successors must fain be content to yield a certain homage to
long-established privileges. It will be a great while yet—at
least a thousand years or so—before the Dryden of Port Sidney
or the Camoens of Paraguay shall venture to say hard
things of May!</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Dyer’s poem of “The Fleece,” though little read now-a-days,
has found warm admirers among the great poets of
England. Akenside once remarked that he should regulate his
opinion of the public taste by the reception of “The Fleece;”
for if it were not to succeed, “he should think it no longer
reasonable to expect fame from excellence.” And Mr. Wordsworth
appears to have been very much of the same opinion:</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bard of 'The Fleece,’ whose skillful genius made</div>
      <div class='line'>That work a living landscape, fair and bright,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Though party Fame hath many a chaplet culled</div>
      <div class='line'>For worthless brows, while in the pensive shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Of cold neglect she leaves thy head ungraced,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet pure and powerful minds, hearts meek and still,</div>
      <div class='line'>A grateful few shall love thy modest lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Long as the shepherd’s bleating flock shall stray</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er naked Snowdon’s wide aerial waste—</div>
      <div class='line'>Long as the thrush shall pipe on Grongar Hill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Dyer is one of those writers whose higher efforts have
been little heeded, while his lesser works have been much
liked. “Grongar Hill” and “The Country Walk” have been
always read with pleasure, while the “Ruins of Rome” and
“The Fleece” lie on the shelf unopened. The saucy critic,
who on hearing, shortly after the publication of “The
Fleece,” that Dyer was growing old, exclaimed, “He will
be buried in woolen!” has proved at least a true seer. The
world never forgives a man of approved talent, who, having
once fixed its attention agreeably, fails in some higher and
later aim. The game of authorship is, in this sense, like
many other games, where, if the last throw is a blank, you
lose all that has been previously won from the pool of fame
and fortune. The public has very little patience. But, on
the other hand, we can not always adhere implicitly to the
opinion of some wiser judge, though he be of the higher
court, who may desire to revoke the earlier general decision.
The literary man usually makes up his mind regarding a book
upon very different grounds from the general reader; the public
decides rapidly, from first impressions, from general views;
it has neither time nor ability to waste on analysis; the critic
delights in looking very closely at his subject, and his enjoyment
of perfection of detail is often too great. The public
is, no doubt, the best judge of the interest of a work, since
it considers little else. The man of letters holds the best
gauge of talent; he appreciates more justly excellency of
workmanship and accuracy of finish. But a really great
book is not written for one class only—it should satisfy the
best of all classes; it must have more than one kind of merit—it
must possess interest for the careless reader, skill and
good workmanship for the critic, power and inspiration to
strike the spark from kindred genius. There is quite a large
class of poetical works especially, which, while they meet
with more or less approbation from the critic, fail to please
generally; they lack interest; the writer has had talent
enough to introduce much that is good, or, perhaps, even admirable
passages, at intervals; but he has not been endowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>with the genius which grasps, and controls, and shapes, and
vivifies every subject which it handles. Among this class
may be placed “The Fleece.” The writer, John Dyer, was
a Welshman of respectable parentage, born in 1700, who first
studied law, then became a painter, and finally took orders in
the Church of England. The extract we have given from
“The Fleece” scarcely does justice to the merits of the
poem, but we have selected it from its predictions regarding
our own country; not only do Virginia and Massachusetts
appear on the scene, but even California figures in these
verses, written more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>PASTORAL SCENE FROM “THE ARCADIA.”</h3>

<p class='c019'>There were hills which garnished their proud heights with stately
trees; humble valleys whose base estate seemed comforted with the refreshing
of silver rivers; meadows enameled with all sorts of eye-pleasing
flowers; thickets which, being lined with most pleasant shade, were
witnessed so by the cheerful disposition of many well-tuned birds; each
pasture stored with sheep feeding with sober security, while the pretty
lambs, with bleating oratory, craved the dam’s comfort; here a shepherd’s
boy piping, as though he should never be old; there a young
shepherdess knitting, and withal singing, and it seemed that her voice
comforted her hands to work, and her hands kept time to her voice-music.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>A FAYRE AND HAPPY MILK-MAID.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Is a countrey wench, that is so farre from making her selfe beautifull
by art, that one looke of hers is able to put <em>all face physicke</em> out of
countenance. She knowes a faire looke is but a <em>dumbe orator</em> to commend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>virtue, therefore minds it not. All her excellencies stand in her
so silently, as if they had stolne upon her without her knowledge. The
lining of her apparall (which is her selfe) is farre better than outsides
of tisseu; for though she be not arraied in the spoile of the silke-worme,
shee is deckt in <em>innocency</em>, a farre better wearing. She doth not, with
lying long abed, spoile both her <em>complexion</em> and <em>conditions</em>. Nature
hath taught her too immoderate sleepe is rust to the soule; she rises,
therefore, with <em>chaunticleare</em>, her dame’s cock, and at night makes the
<em>lambe</em> her <em>curfew</em>. In milking a cow, a-straining the <em>teats</em> through her
fingers, it seems that so sweete a milk-presse makes the milk the whiter
or sweeter; for never came <em>almond glove</em>, or <em>aromatique oyntment</em> on
her palme to taint it. The golden eares of corne fall and kisse her feet
when she reapes them, as if they wisht to be bound, and led prisoners
by the same hand that fell’d them. Her breath is her own, which scents
all the yeare long of <em>June</em>, like a new-made hay-cocke. She makes her
hand hard with labour, and her heart soft with pity; and when winter
evenings fall early (sitting at her mery wheele) she sings a defiance to
the giddy <em>wheele of fortune</em>. She doth all things with so sweet a grace,
it seems <em>ignorance</em> will not suffer her to do ill, being her mind is to doe
well. She bestowes her yeare’s wages at next faire; and in chusing her
garments, counts no bravery i’ the world like decency. The <em>garden</em>
and <em>bee-hive</em> are all her physick and chyrurgerye, and shee lives the
longer for’t. She dares goe alone, and unfold sheepe i’ the night, and
feares no manner of ill, because she meanes none; yet to say truth, she
is never alone, for she is still accompanied with <em>old songs</em>, <em>honest
thoughts</em>, and <em>prayers</em>, but short ones; yet they have their efficacy, in
that they are not pauled with ensuing idle cogitations. Lastly: her
dreams are so chaste, that she dare tell them; only a Fridaie’s dream is
all her <em>superstition</em>: that shee conceales for feare of anger. Thus lives
she, and all her care is that she may die in the <em>spring-time</em>, to have
store of flowers stucke upon her winding-sheet.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SHEEP-PASTURES.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The Teviot takes its course through wide valleys of smooth, extended
pasturage, sloping down to it in all directions, and in general forming
beautiful lines, though otherwise void of all those circumstances, and
that variety of objects, particularly of wood, which give beauty to landscape.
In some parts these valleys are also contracted, but in a different
manner from those of the Esk. The same breadth of feature is still
preserved which we had in the more open parts, only it is here brought
nearer to the eye. Though the lofty skreens rush down precipitately to
the river, and contract the valleys, you see plainly they are the parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>a large-featured country, and in a style of landscape very different from
those little irriguous valleys which we had left.</p>

<p class='c012'>The downy sides of all these valleys are covered with sheep, which
often appear to hang upon immense green walls. So steep is the descent
in some parts, that the eye from the bottom scarce distinguishes the
slope from a perpendicular. Several of these mountainous slopes (for
some of them are very lofty) are finely tinted with mosses of different
hues, which give them a very rich surface. This, however, is probably
the garb which nature wears only in the summer months. She has a
variety of dresses for all seasons, and all so becoming, that when she deposits
one, and assumes another, she is always adorned with beauties
peculiar to herself.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Among the pieces in the following group will be found
some old verses of Gawain Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld.
This ancient Scottish poet and Church dignitary was a son
of the famous Archibald, earl of Argus, surnamed Bell-the-Cat,
from his share in one of the peculiar conspiracies of that
strange period—a conspiracy which resulted in hanging a
number of the royal favorites of James III., chiefly architects
and musicians, ennobled by that prince. James was in this
respect too liberal in his tastes to please the fierce old barons
surrounding his throne, though doubtless his favor was often
weakly lavished upon those in whose society he took pleasure.
But one would hardly have expected to find the leader of such
a conspiracy the father of a distinguished poet; such, however,
was the fact. Bishop Gawain was a great clerk in his
day. He wrote a metrical version of the Æneid in the Scottish
dialect, and many lesser poetical works, admitted to possess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>great merit. Sir Walter Scott has introduced both father
and son in Marmion. He makes old Bell-the-Cat appear in
his true character:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A letter forged! Saint Jude to speed!</div>
      <div class='line'>Did ever knight so foul a deed!</div>
      <div class='line'>At first in heart it liked me ill,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the king praised his clerkly skill.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thanks to Saint Bothan, son of mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save Gawain, ne’er could pen a line;</div>
      <div class='line'>So swore I, and I swear it still—</div>
      <div class='line'>Let my boy-bishop fret his fill.”</div>
      <div class='line in56'><cite>Canto VI.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And in another passage we have the poet-bishop himself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Amid that dim and smoky light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Checkering the silver moonshine bright—</div>
      <div class='line in4'>A bishop by the altar stood,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>A noble lord of Douglas’ blood.</div>
      <div class='line'>With mitre sheen, and rocquet white.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet show’d his meek and thoughtful eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>But little pride of prelacy;</div>
      <div class='line'>More pleased that in a barbarous age</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave rude Scotland Virgil’s page,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than that beneath his rule he held</div>
      <div class='line'>The bishopric of fair Dunkeld.”</div>
      <div class='line in56'><cite>Canto VI.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Bishop Gawain was compelled by the troubles in Scotland
to flee from his native country, and to take refuge at the court
of Henry VIII., where he lived for years an honored exile,
dying in 1522, at London, of the plague. He was born in
1474. Each canto of his translation of Virgil was preceded
by an original prologue; the address to Spring—whence the
extract on flowers is taken—is one of the most pleasing of
these, and forms his introduction to the 12th Canto of the
Æneid. Far from regretting the Scotticisms of his style, the
bishop only mourned that his verses were still so English in
their aspect: a defect which will not be likely to strike the
modern reader. But in spite of the obsolete words and rugged
style, the touch of a poetical spirit, and something of the
freshness of the natural blossoms still lingers about Bishop
Gawain’s Spring chaplet.</p>

    <div><span class='small'>FROM “JOURNAL OF A NATURALIST.”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The amusements and fancies of children, when connected with flowers,
are always pleasing, being generally the conceptions of innocent
minds unbiased by artifice or pretense; and their love of them seems
to spring from a genuine feeling and admiration—a kind of sympathy
with objects as fair as their own untainted minds; and I think it is
early flowers which constitute their first natural playthings; though
summer presents a greater number and variety, they are not so fondly
selected. We have our daisies strung and wreathed about our dress;
our coronals of orchises and primroses, our cowslip balls, etc.; and one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>application of flowers at this season I have noticed, which, though perhaps
it is local, yet it has a remarkably pretty effect, forming, for the
time, one of the gayest little shrubs that can be seen. A small branch
or long spray of the whitethorn, with all its spines uninjured, is selected;
and on these, its alternate thorns, a white and blue violet, plucked from
their stalks, are stuck upright in succession, until the thorns are covered,
and when placed in a flower-pot of moss, it has perfectly the appearance
of a beautiful vernal flowering dwarf shrub, and as long as it
remains fresh is an object of surprise and delight.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I must tell you a feat of my dog Beau. Walking by the river side, I
observed some water-lilies floating at a little distance from the bank.
They are a large white flower, with an orange-colored eye, very beautiful.
I had a desire to gather one, and, having your long cane in my
hand, by the help of it endeavored to bring one of them within my
reach. But the attempt proved vain, and I walked forward. Beau had
all the while observed me very attentively. Returning soon after toward
the same place, I observed him plunge into the river, while I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>about forty yards distant from him; and, when I had nearly reached
the spot, he swam to land, with a lily in his mouth, which he came and
laid at my feet.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>GRASS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Is all grass? Make you no distinction? No; all is grass; or if you
will have some other name, be it so. Once, this is true, that all flesh is
grass; and if that glory which shines so much in your eyes must have
a difference, then this is all that it can have—it is but the flower of
that same grass; somewhat above the common grass in gayness, a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>comelier and better appareled than it, but partakes of its frail and fading
nature. It hath no privilege nor immunity that way; yea, of the
two is less durable, and usually shorter lived; at the last it decays with
it. “The grass withereth; and the flower thereof fadeth away.”</p>

    <div><span class='small'>FROM REV. GILBERT WHITE, OF SELBORNE.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In the court of Norton farm-house, a manor farm to the northwest of
the village, on the White Malms, stood within these twenty years a
broad-leaved elm, or wych hazel, <em>ulmus folio latissimo scabro</em>, of Ray,
which, though it had lost a considerable leading bough in the great
storm in the year 1703, equal to a moderate tree, yet, when felled, contained
eight loads of timber; and, being too bulky for a carriage, was
sawn off at seven feet above the butt, where it measured near eight feet
in diameter. This elm I mention to show to what a bulk planted elms
may attain, as this tree must certainly have been such from its situation.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the center of the village, and near the church, is a square piece of
ground, surrounded by houses, and commonly called the Plestor. Sir
Adam Gurdon, in conjunction with his wife Constantia, in the year 1271,
granted to the prior and convent of Selborne all his right and claim to a
certain place, <em>placea</em>, called <em>La Pleystow</em>, in the village aforesaid, “<em>in
liberam, puram, et perpetuam elimosinam</em>.” This Pleystow, <em>locus ludorum</em>,
or play-place, is a level area, near the church, of about forty-four
yards by thirty-six, and is known now by the name of the Plestor.
It continues still—as it was in old times—to be the scene of recreation
for the youths and children of the neighborhood, and impresses an idea
on the mind that this village, even in Saxon times, could not be the most
abject of places, when the inhabitants thought proper to assign so spacious
a spot for the sports and amusements of its young people. In the
midst of this spot stood in old times a vast oak, with a short, squat
body, and huge horizontal arms extending almost to the extremity of the
area. This venerable tree, surrounded with stone steps, and seats above
them, was the delight of old and young, and a place of much resort in
summer evenings, where the former sat in grave debate, while the latter
frolicked and danced before them. Long might it have stood had not
the amazing tempest in 1703 overturned it at once, to the infinite regret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of the inhabitants and the vicar, who bestowed several pounds in setting
it in its place again; but all his care could not avail; the tree sprouted
for a time, then withered and died. This oak I mention to show to what
a bulk planted oaks also may arrive; and planted this tree must certainly
have been, as appears from what is known concerning the antiquities
of the village.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the Blackmoor estate there is a small wood, called Losel’s, of a few
acres, that was lately furnished with a set of oaks of a peculiar growth
and great value; they were tall and taper like firs, but, standing near
together, had very small heads—only a little brush, without any large
limbs. About twenty years ago the bridge at the Toy, near Hampton
Court, being much decayed, some trees were wanted for the repairs that
were fifty feet long without a bough, and would measure twelve inches
diameter at the little end. Twenty such trees did a purveyor find in
this little wood, with this advantage, that many of them answered the
description at fifty feet. These trees were sold for £20 a piece.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the center of this grove there stood an oak, which, though shapely
and tall on the whole, bulged out into a large excrescence about the middle
of the stem. On this a pair of ravens had fixed their residence for
such a series of years, that the oak was distinguished by the title of the
Raven-tree! Many were the attempts of the neighboring youths to get
at this eyry; the difficulty whetted their inclinations, and each was ambitious
of surmounting the arduous task; but when they arrived at the
swelling, it jutted out so in their way, and was so far beyond their
grasp, that the most daring lads were awed, and acknowledged the undertaking
to be too hazardous. So the ravens built on, nest upon nest,
in perfect security, till the fatal day arrived in which the wood was to
be leveled. It was in the month of February, when these birds usually
sit. The saw was applied to the butt; the wedges were inserted into the
opening; the woods echoed to the heavy blows of the beetle or mallet;
the tree nodded to the fall; but still the dam sat on. At last, when it
gave way, the bird was flung from her nest; and though her parental
affection deserved a better fate, was whipped down by the twigs, which
brought her dead to the ground.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>AN ENGLISH PEASANT’S COTTAGE.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The prettiest cottage on our village green is the little dwelling of
Dame Wilson. It stands in a corner of the common, where the hedge-rows
go curving off into a sort of bay round a clear bright pond, the
earliest haunt of the swallow. A deep, woody green lane, such as Hobbima
or Ruysdael might have painted—a lane that hints of nightingales,
forms one boundary of the garden, and a sloping meadow the other;
while the cottage itself, a low, thatched, irregular building, backed by a
blooming orchard, and covered with honeysuckle and jessamine, looks
like the chosen abode of snugness and comfort. And so it is.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FROM “THE COMPLETE ANGLER.”</h3>

<p class='c019'><em>Ven.</em> On my word, master, this is a gallant trout; what shall we do
with him?</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Pisc.</em> Marry, e’en eat him to supper: we’ll go to my hostess, from
whence we came; she told me, as I was going out of door, that my
brother Peter, a good angler, and a cheerful companion, had sent word
he would lodge there to-night, and bring a friend with him. My hostess
has two beds, and I know you and I may have the best. We’ll rejoice
with my brother Peter and his friend, tell tales, or sing ballads, or make
a catch, or find some harmless sport to content us, and pass away a little
time without offense to God or man.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Ven.</em> A match, good master: let’s go to that house, for the linen
looks white, and smells of lavender, and I long to lie in a pair of sheets
that smell so. Let’s be going, good master, for I am hungry again with
fishing.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Pisc.</em> Nay, stay a little, good scholar; I caught my last trout with a
worm. Now I will put on a minnow, and try a quarter of an hour about
yonder trees for another, and so walk toward our lodging. Look you,
scholar, thereabout we shall have a bite presently, or not at all. Have
with you, sir, o’ my word I have hold of him. Oh, it is a great loggerheaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>chub; come, hang him upon that willow twig, and let’s be going.
But turn out of the way a little, good scholar, toward yonder high
honeysuckle hedge; there we’ll sit and sing while this shower falls so
gently upon the teeming earth, and gives yet a sweeter smell to the lovely
flowers that adorn these verdant meadows.</p>

<p class='c012'>Look! under that broad beach-tree I sat down when I was last this
way a fishing, and the birds in the adjoining grove seemed to have a
friendly contention with an echo, whose dead voice seemed to live in a
hollow tree, near to the brow of that primrose hill; there I sat viewing
the silver streams glide silently toward their center, the tempestuous
sea, yet sometimes opposed by rugged roots and pebble-stones, which
broke their waves and turned them into foam; and sometimes I beguiled
time by viewing the harmless lambs—some leaping securely in the cool
shade, while others sported themselves in the cheerful sun; and saw
others craving comfort from the swollen udders of their bleating dams.
As I thus sat, these and other sights had so fully possessed my soul with
content, that I thought, as the poet has happily expressed it,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I was for that time lifted above earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And possess’d joys not promis’d in my birth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>As I left this place, and entered into the next field, a second pleasure
entertained me; it was a handsome milk-maid, that had not yet attained
so much age and wisdom as to load her mind with any fears of many
things that will never be, as too many men too often do; but she cast
away all care, and sung like a nightingale: her voice was good, and the
ditty fitted for it; it was that smooth song which was made by Kit
Marlow, now at least fifty years ago; and the milk-maid’s mother sung
an answer to it, which was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger
days.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were old-fashioned poetry, but choicely good—I think much better
than the strong lines that are now in fashion in this critical age.
Look yonder! on my word, yonder they both be, a milking again. I
will give her the chub, and persuade them to sing those two songs
to us.</p>

<p class='c012'>God speed you, good woman! I have been a fishing, and am going
to Bleak-Hall to my bed, and having caught more fish than will sup myself
and my friend, I will bestow this upon you and your daughter, for I
use to sell none.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Milk-W.</em> Marry, God requite you, sir, and we’ll eat it cheerfully;
and if you come this way a fishing two months hence, o’ grace of God,
I’ll give you a syllabub of new verjuice, in a new-made hay-cock for it,
and my Maudlin shall sing you one of her best ballads; for she and I
both love all anglers, they be such honest, civil, quiet men. In the
mean time, will you drink a draught of red cow’s milk? you shall have
it freely.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span><em>Pisc.</em> No, I thank you; but I pray do us a courtesy that shall stand
you and your daughter in nothing, and yet we will think ourselves still
something in your debt: it is but to sing us a song that was sung by
your daughter when I last passed over this meadow about eight or nine
days since.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Milk-M.</em> What song was it, I pray? Was it, “Come, Shepherds,
Deck your Heads?” or “As at Noon Dulcina Rested?” or “Phillida,
Flout me?” or “Chevy Chase?” or “Johnny Armstrong?” or “Troy
Town?”</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Pisc.</em> It is none of those; it is a song that your daughter sung the
first part, and you sung the answer to it.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Milk-W.</em> O, I know it now; I learned the first part in my golden
age, when I was about the age of my poor daughter; and the latter
part—which indeed fits me best now—but two or three years ago, when
the cares of the world began to take hold of me; but you shall, God
willing, hear them both, and sung as well as we can, for we both love
anglers. Come, Maudlin, sing the first part to the gentlemen with a
merry heart, and I’ll sing the second when you have done:</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Ven.</em> Trust me, master, it is a choice song, and sweetly sung by
honest Maudlin. I now see it was not without cause that our good
Queen Elizabeth did so often wish herself a milk-maid all the month of
May, because they are not troubled with fears and cares, but sing
sweetly all the day, and sleep securely all the night; and without doubt
honest, innocent, pretty Maudlin does so. I’ll bestow Sir Thomas Overbury’s

<p class='c012'>Among the manifold creatures of God that have in all ages diversely
entertained many excellent wits, and drawne them to the contemplation
of the Divine Wisdome, none have provoked men’s studies more, or
satisfied their desires so much, as plants have done, and that upon just
and worthy causes; for what greater delight is there than to behold the
earth appareled with plants as with a robe of embroidered worke, set
with orient pearles, and garnished with great diversity of rare and costly
jewels. But the principal delighte is in the minde, singularly enriched
with the knowledge of these visible things, setting forth to us the invisible

<h3 class='c014'>OF GARDENS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>God Almighty first planted a garden; and, indeed, it is the purest of
human pleasures; it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man;
without which buildings and palaces are but gross handiwork; and as
men shall ever see, that, when ages grow to civility and elegancy, men
come to build stately, sooner than to garden finely, as if gardening were
the greater perfection. I do hold it in the royal ordering of gardens,
there ought to be gardens for all the months in the year, in which, severally,
things of beauty may be in season.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air (where it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>comes and goes, like the warbling of music) than in the hand, therefore
nothing is more fit for that delight than to know what be the flowers and
plants that do best perfume the air. Roses, damask and red, are fast
flowers of their smells, so that you may walk by a whole row of them, and
find nothing of their sweetness; yea, though it be in a morning’s dew.
Bays, likewise, yield no smell as they grow; rosemary little, nor sweet
marjoram; that which above all others yields the sweetest smell in the
air is the violet, which comes twice a year, about the middle of April,
and about Bartholomew-tide. Next to that is the musk rose; then the
strawberry leaves dying, with a most excellent cordial smell; then the
flower of the vines—it is a little dust, like the dust of a bent, which
grows upon the cluster in the first coming forth; then sweet-brier, then
wall-flowers, which are very delightful to be set under a parlor or lower
chamber window; then pinks and gilliflowers, especially the matted
pink and clove gilliflowers; then the honeysuckles, so that they be somewhat
afar off. Of bean-flowers I speak not, because they are field-flowers;
but those which perfume the air most delightfully, not passed by
as the rest, but being trodden upon and crushed, are three, that is, burnet,
wild thyme, and water-mints; therefore you are to set whole alleys
of them, to have the pleasure when you walk or tread.</p>

<p class='c012'>For gardens (speaking of those which are indeed prince-like, as we
have done of buildings), the contents ought not well to be under thirty
acres of ground, and to be divided into three parts: a green in the entrance,
a heath or desert in the going forth, and the main garden in
the midst, besides alleys on both sides; and I like well that four acres
of ground be assigned to the green, six to the heath, four and four to
either side, and twelve to the main garden. The green hath two pleasures:
the one, because nothing is more pleasant to the eye than green
grass kept finely shorn; the other, because it will give you a fair alley
in the midst, by which you may go in front upon a stately hedge, which
is to inclose the garden; but because the alley will be long, and, in great
heat of the year, or day, you ought not to leave the shade in the garden
by going in the sun through the green, therefore you are, of either
side the green, to plant a covert alley upon carpenter’s work, about
twelve foot in height, by which you may go in shade into the garden.
As for the making of knots or figures with divers colored earths, that
they may lie under the windows of the house on that side which the garden
stands, they be but toys; you may see as good sights many times in
tarts.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>GARDENING.</h3>

<p class='c019'>For my own part, as the country life, and this part of it more particularly
(namely, gardening), were the inclination of my youth itself, so
they are the pleasure of my age; and I can truly say, that among many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>great employments that have fallen to my share, I have never asked or
sought for any one of them, but often endeavored to escape from them,
into the ease and freedom of a private scene, where a man may go his
own way and his own pace in the common paths or circles of life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The measure of choosing well is, whether a man likes what he has
chosen, which, I thank God, has befallen me; and though among the
follies of my life building and planting have not been the least, and have
cost me more than I have the confidence to own, yet they have been fully
recompensed by the sweetness and satisfaction of this retreat, where,
since my resolution taken of never entering again into any public employments,
I have passed five years without ever going once to town,
though I am almost in sight of it, and have a house there always ready
to receive me. Nor has this been any sort of affectation, as some have
thought it, but a mere want of desire or humor to make so small a remove.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>No portion of creation has been resorted to by mankind with more success
for the ornament and decoration of their labors than the vegetable
world. The rites, emblems, and mysteries of religion; national achievements,
eccentric masks, and the capricious visions of fancy, have been
wrought by the hand of the sculptor on the temple, the altar, or the tomb;
but plants, their foliage, flowers, or fruits, as the most graceful, varied,
and pleasing objects that meet our view, have been more universally the
object of design, and have supplied the most beautiful, and perhaps the
earliest, embellishments of art. The pomegranate, the almond, and flowers
were selected, even in the wilderness by divine appointment, to give
form to the sacred utensils; the rewards of merit, the wreath of the
victor, were arboraceous. In later periods the acanthus, the ivy, the
lotus, the vine, the palm, and the oak flourished under the chisel or in
the loom of the artist; and in modern days the vegetable world affords
the almost exclusive decorations of ingenuity and art. The cultivation
of flowers is, of all the amusements of mankind, the one to be selected
and approved as the most innocent in itself, and most perfectly devoid
of injury or annoyance to others; the employment is not only conducive
to health and peace of mind, but probably more good-will has arisen
and friendships been founded by the intercourse and communication
connected with this pursuit than from any other whatsoever; the pleasures,
the ecstasies of the horticulturist are harmless and pure; a streak,
a tint, a shade, becomes his triumph, which, though often obtained by
chance, are secured alone by morning care, by evening caution, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the vigilance of days—an employ which in its various grades excludes
neither the opulent nor the indigent, and, teeming with boundless variety,
affords an unceasing excitement to emulation, without contempt
or ill-will.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHINESE GARDENING.</h3>

<p class='c019'>What is it that we seek in the possession of a pleasure-garden? The
art of laying out gardens consists in an endeavor to combine cheerfulness
of aspect, luxuriance of growth, shade, solitude, and repose in such
a manner that the senses may be deluded by an imitation of rural nature.
Diversity, which is the main advantage of free landscape, must
therefore be sought in a judicious choice of soil, an alternation of chains
of hills and valleys, gorges, brooks, and lakes covered with aquatic
plants. Symmetry is wearying, and ennui and disgust will soon be excited
in a garden where every part betrays constraint and art.</p>

      <div class='line'>When the light flourish of the blue-bird sounds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the south wind comes blandly; when the sky</div>
      <div class='line'>Is soft in delicate blue, with melting pearl</div>
      <div class='line'>Spotting its bosom, all proclaiming Spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh with what joy the garden spot we greet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wakening from wintry slumbers. As we tread</div>
      <div class='line'>The branching walks, within its hollow’d nook</div>
      <div class='line'>We see the violet by some lingering flake</div>
      <div class='line'>Of melting snow, its sweet eye lifting up,</div>
      <div class='line'>As welcoming our presence; o’er our heads</div>
      <div class='line'>The fruit-tree buds are swelling, and we hail</div>
      <div class='line'>Our grateful task of molding into form</div>
      <div class='line'>The waste around us. The quick delving spade</div>
      <div class='line'>Upturns the fresh and odorous earth; the rake</div>
      <div class='line'>Smooths the plump bed, and in their furrow’d graves</div>
      <div class='line'>We drop the seed. The robin stops his work</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the apple-bough, and flutters down</div>
      <div class='line'>Stealing, with oft check’d and uplifted foot</div>

      <div class='line'>Days pass along. The pattering shower falls down</div>

      <div class='line'>The trellis stretch the tendrils, sharply prong’d,</div>

<p class='c019'>But as when the sun approaches toward the gates of the morning, he
first opens a little eye of heaven, and sends away the spirits of darkness,
and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark to matins, and
by-and-by gilds the fringes of a cloud, and peeps over the eastern hills,
thrusting out his golden horns—like those which decked the brows of
Moses, when he was forced to wear a vail, because himself had seen the
face of God; and still, while a man tells the story, the sun gets up higher
till he shows a fair face and full light, and then he shines one whole
day, under a cloud often, and sometimes weeping great and little showers,
and sets quickly: so is a man’s reason and his life.</p>

not to be imagined, without the experience of it, what prodigious numbers
a very small spot of ground, well-cultivated, and destined for this
purpose, would be able to furnish toward the sending forth of yearly
colonies into all the naked quarters of a lordship, or demesne; being,
with a pleasant industry, liberally distributed among the tenants, and
disposed about the hedge-rows, and other waste and uncultivated places
for timber, shelter, fuel, and ornament, to an incredible advantage.
This being a cheap and laudable work, of so much pleasure in the execution,
and so certain a profit in the event, when once well done (for, as
I affirmed, a very small plantarium, or nursery, will, in a few years,
stock a vast extent of ground), has made me sometimes in admiration at
the universal negligence; as well as raised my admiration, that seeds
and plants of such different kinds, should, like so many tender babes
and infants suck and thrive at the same breasts; though there are
some, indeed, will not so well prosper in company, requiring peculiar
juices. But this niceness is more conspicuous in flowers and the herbaceous
offspring, than in foresters, which require only diligent weeding
and frequent cleansing, till they are able to shift for themselves; and
as their vessels enlarge and introduce more copious nourishment, they
often starve their neighbors.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FAIRLOP.</h3>

<p class='c019'>In a glade of Hainhault forest, in Essex, about a mile from Barkinside,
stands an oak, which has been known through many centuries by
the name of Fairlop. The traditions of the country trace it half way
up the Christian era. It is still a noble tree, though it has now suffered
greatly from the depredations of time. About a yard from the ground,
where its rough, fluted stem is thirty-six feet in circumference, it divides
into eleven arms; yet not in the horizontal manner of an oak, but
rather in that of a beech. Beneath its shade, which overspreads an area
of three hundred feet in circuit, an annual fair has long been held, on
the 2d of July; and no booth is suffered to be erected beyond the extent
of its boughs. But as their extremities are now become sapless, and
age is yearly curtailing their length, the liberties of the fair seem to be
in a desponding condition. The honor however is great. But honors
are often accompanied with inconveniences; and Fairlop has suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>from its distinctions. In the feasting that attends the fair, fires are
often necessary; and no places seemed so proper to make them in, as
the hollow cavities formed by the heaving roots of the tree. This practice
has brought a speedier decay on Fairlop than it might otherwise
have suffered.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since your departure I have twice visited the oak, with an intention

found another oak, much larger, and much more respectable than the
former; but once I was hindered by the rain, and once by the sultriness
of the day. This latter oak has been known by the name of
“Judith” many ages, and is said to have been an oak at the time of
the Conquest. If I have not an opportunity to reach it before your arrival
here, we will attempt that exploit together, and even if I should
have been able to visit it ere you come, I shall yet be glad to do so, for

<h3 class='c014'>THE GROANING ELM OF BADESLEY.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The history of the Groaning Tree is this. About forty years ago, a
cottager, who lived near the center of the village (Badesley, near Lymington),
heard frequently a strange noise behind his house, like that of
a person in extreme agony. Soon after it caught the attention of his
wife, who was then confined to her bed. She was a timorous woman,
and being greatly alarmed, her husband endeavored to persuade her
that the noise she heard was only the bellowing of the stags in the
forest. By degrees, however, the neighbors on all sides heard it, and
the thing began to be much talked of. It was by this time plainly discovered
that the groaning noise proceeded from an elm, which grew at
the end of the garden. It was a young, vigorous tree, and, to all appearance,
perfectly sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a few weeks the fame of the groaning tree was spread far and
wide, and people from all parts flocked to it. Among others, it attracted
the curiosity of the late Prince and Princess of Wales,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> who resided,
at that time for the advantage of a sea-bath, at Pilewell, the seat of Sir
James Worsley, which stood within a quarter of a mile of the groaning
tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>Though the country people assigned many superstitious causes for this
strange phenomenon, the naturalist could assign no physical one that
was in any degree satisfactory. Some thought that it was owing to the
twisting and friction of the roots. Others thought it proceeded from
water, which had collected in the body of the tree—or perhaps from
pent air. But no cause that was alleged appeared equal to the effect.
In the mean time the tree did not always groan—sometimes disappointing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>its visitants; yet no cause could be assigned for its temporary cessations,
either from seasons or weather. If any difference was observed,
it was thought to groan least when the weather was wet, and most
when it was clear and frosty; but the sound at all times seemed to arise
from the root.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the groaning tree continued an object of astonishment during
the space of eighteen or twenty months, to all the country around; and
for the information of distant parts a pamphlet was drawn up containing
a particular account of all the circumstances relating to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>At length the owner of it, a gentleman of the name of Forbes, making
too rash an experiment to discover the cause, bored a hole in its trunk.
After this it never groaned. It was then rooted up, with a further view
to making a discovery; but still nothing appeared which led to any investigation
of the cause. It was universally, however, believed that there
was no trick in the affair, but that some natural cause really existed,
though never understood.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LIME-TREES.</h3>

<p class='c019'>At Niestad,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> in the duchy of Wurtemburg, stood a lime, which was for
many ages so remarkable that the city frequently took its denomination
from it, being often called <em><span lang="de">Neustadt <a id='t202'></a>an der grossen Linden</span></em>, or Niestad
near the Great Lime. Scarce any person passed near Niestad without
visiting this tree; and many princes and great men did honor to it by
building obelisks, columns, and monuments of various kinds around it,
engraved with their arms and names, to which the dates were added,
and often some device. Mr. Evelin, who procured copies of several of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>these monumental inscriptions, tells us there were two hundred of them.
The columns on which they were fixed served also to bear up the vast
limbs of the tree, which began through age to become unwieldy. Thus
this mighty plant stood many years in great state, the ornament of the
town, the admiration of the country, and supported, as it were, by the
princes of the empire. At length it felt the effects of war. Niestad was
surrounded by an enemy, and the limbs of this venerable tree were mangled
in wantonness by the besieging troops. Whether it still exists, I
know not; but long after these injuries it stood a noble ruin, discovering,
by the foundations of the several monuments, which formerly propped
its spreading boughs, how far its limits had once extended.</p>

<p class='c012'>*  *  *  I shall next celebrate the Lime of Cleves. This, also, was a
tree of great magnificence. It grew in an open plain, just at the entrance
of the city, and was thought an object worthy to exercise the
taste of the magistracy. The burgomaster of his day had it surveyed
with great accuracy, and trimmed into eight broad, pyramidal faces.
Each corner was supported by a handsome stone pillar; and in the middle
of the tree, among the branches, was cut a noble room, which the
vast space contained within easily suffered, without injuring the regularity
of any of the eight faces. To crown all, the top was curiously
clipped into some kind of head, and adorned artificially, but in what
manner, whether with the head of a lion, or a stag, a weather-cock, or a
sun-dial, we are not told. It was something, however, in the highest
style of Dutch taste. This tree was long the admiration and envy of all
the states of Holland.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>A PINE-FOREST.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Those who have only lived in forest countries, where vast tracts are
shaded by a dense growth of oak, ash, chestnut, hickory, and other trees
of deciduous foliage, which present the most pleasing varieties of verdure
and freshness, can have but little idea of the effect produced on the
feelings by aged forests of pine, composed in great degree of a single
species, whose towering summits are crowned with one dark-green canopy,
which successive seasons find unchanged, and nothing but death
causes to vary. Their robust and gigantic trunks rise a hundred or
more feet high in purely proportioned columns before the limbs begin to
diverge; and their tops, densely clothed with long, bristling foliage, intermingle
so closely as to allow of but slight entrance to the sun. Hence
the undergrowth of such forests is comparatively slight and thin, since
none but shrubs and plants that love the shade can flourish under this
perpetual exclusion of the animating and invigorating rays of the great
exciter of the vegetable world. Through such forests, and by the
merest foot-paths in great part, it was my lot to pass many miles almost
every day; and had I not endeavored to derive some amusement and
instruction from the study of the forest itself, my time would have been
as fatiguing to me as it was certainly quiet and solemn. But wherever
Nature is, and under whatever form she may present herself, enough is
always proffered to fix attention and to produce pleasure, if we will condescend
to observe with carefulness. I soon found that even a pine-forest
was far from being devoid of interest.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'><em>Hal.</em> While we have been conversing, the May-flies, which were in
such quantities, have become much fewer; and I believe the reason is,
that they have been greatly diminished by the flocks of swallows which
everywhere pursue them. I have seen a single swallow take four, in
less than a quarter of a minute, that were descending to the water.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Poict.</em> I delight in this living landscape! The swallow is one of my
favorite birds, and a rival of the nightingale; for he cheers my sense
of seeing as much as the other does my sense of hearing. He is the glad
prophet of the year—the harbinger of the best season: he lives a life
of enjoyment among the loveliest forms of Nature. Winter is unknown
to him; and he leaves the green meadows of England, in autumn, for the
myrtle and orange groves of Italy, and for the palms of Africa. He has
always objects of pursuit, and his success is secure. Even the beings
selected for his prey are poetical, beautiful, and transient. The ephemeræ
are saved by his means from a slow and lingering death in the
evening, and killed in a moment, when they have known nothing of life
but pleasure. He is the constant destroyer of insects—the friend of
man; and, with the stork and ibis, may be regarded as a sacred bird.
This instinct, which gives him his appointed seasons, and teaches him
always when and where to move, may be regarded as flowing from a
Divine Source; and he belongs to the Oracles of Nature, which speak
the awful and intelligible language of a present Deity.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>EXTRACT.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>FROM “JOURNAL OF A NATURALIST.”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Rural sounds, the voices, the language of the wild creatures, as heard
by the naturalist, belong to, and are in concord with, the country only.
Our sight, our smell may perhaps be deceived for an interval by conservatories,
horticultural arts, and bowers of sweets; but our hearing
can in no way be beguiled by any semblance of what is heard in the
grove or the field. The hum, the murmur, the medley of the mead, is
peculiarly its own, admits of no imitation, and the voices of our birds
convey particular intimation, and distinctly notify the various periods
of the year with an accuracy as certain as they are detailed in our calendars.
The season of spring is always announced as approaching by
the notes of the rookery, by the jingle or wooing accents of the dark
frequenters of the trees; and that time having passed away, these contentions
and cadences are no longer heard. The cuckoo then comes and
informs us that spring has arrived; that he has journeyed to see us,
borne by gentle gales in sunny days; that fragrant flowers are in the
copse and the mead, and all things telling of gratulation and of joy;
the children mark this well-known sound, spring out, and cuckoo!
cuckoo! as they gambol down the lane; the very plow-boy bids him
welcome in early morn. It is hardly spring without the cuckoo’s song;
and, having told his tale, he has voice for no more—is silent or away.
Then comes the dark, swift-winged marten, glancing through the air,
that seems afraid to visit our uncertain clime; he comes, though late,
and hurries through his business here eager again to depart, all day long
in agitation and precipitate flight. The bland zephyrs of the spring
have no charms for them; but basking and careering in the sultry
gleams of June and July, they associate in throngs, and, screaming,
dash round the steeple or the ruined tower, to serenade their nesting
mates; and glare and heat are in their train. When the fervor of
summer ceases, this bird of the sun will depart. The evening robin,
from the summit of some leafless bough or projecting point, tells us that
autumn is come, and brings matured fruits, chilly airs, and sober hours;
and he, the lonely minstrel that now sings, is understood by all. These
four birds thus indicate a separate season, have no interference with the
intelligence of the other, nor could they be transposed without the loss
of all the meaning they convey, which no contrivance of art could supply;
and, by long association, they have become identified with the period,
and in peculiar accordance with the time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Pretty bird, how cheerfully dost thou sit and sing, and yet knowest
not where thou art, nor where thou shalt make thy next meal; and at
night must shroud thyself in a bush for lodging! What shame is it for
me, that see before me so liberal provisions of my God, and find myself
sit warm under my own roof, yet am ready to droop under a distrustful
and unthankful dullness. Had I so little certainty of my harbor and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>purveyance, how heartless should I be, how careful; how little list
should I have to make music to thee or myself. Surely thou comest not
hither without a Providence. God sent thee not so much to delight, as
to shame me, but all in a conviction of my sullen unbelief, who, under
more apparent means, am less cheerful and confident; reason and faith
have not done so much in me, as in thee mere instinct of nature; want
of foresight makes thee more merry, if not more happy here, than the
foresight of better things maketh me.</p>

<p class='c012'>O God, thy providence is not impaired by those powers thou hast given

  <h2 class='c006'>XIV.<br> <span class='blackletter'>The Butterfly.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The “Fate of the Butterfly” is one of the most charming
of Spenser’s lesser poems; and as it is seldom met with
on American bookshelves, it has been inserted entire, or at
least with the exception of a verse or two, in the present
volume.</p>

<p class='c012'>Familiar as we are with them, we seldom bear in mind
how much the more pleasing varieties of the insect race add
to the beauty and interest of the earth. Setting aside the
important question of their different uses, and the appropriate
tasks allotted to each—forgetting for the moment what we
owe to the bee, and the silkworm, and the coral insect, with
others of the same class—we are very apt to underrate them
even as regards the pleasure and gratification they afford us.
The utter absence of insect life is one of the most striking
characteristics of our Northern American winters. Let us
suppose for a moment that something of the same kind were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to mark one single summer of our lives—that the hum of the
bee, the drone of the beetle, the chirrup of cricket, locust, and
katydid, the noiseless flight of gnat, moth, and butterfly, and
the flash of the firefly, were suddenly to cease from the days
and nights of June—suppose a magic sleep to fall upon them
all; let their tiny but wonderful forms vanish from their usual
haunts; let their ceaseless, cheery chant of day and night
be hushed, should we not be oppressed with the strange stillness?
Should we not look wistfully about for more than one
familiar creature? The gardens and the meadows would in
very sooth scarce seem themselves without this lesser world
of insect life, moving in busy, gay, unobtrusive variety among
the plants they love; and we may well believe that we should
gladly welcome back the lowliest of the beetles, and the most
humble of the moths which have so often crossed our path.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FLOWERS AND INSECTS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Flowers seem, as it were, to impart a portion of their own characteristics
to all things that frequent them. This is peculiarly exemplified
in the butterfly, which must be regarded, <em>par excellence</em>, as the insect
of flowers, and a flower-like insect, gay and innocent, made after a
floral pattern, and colored after floral hues. But even with families
which are usually dark and repulsive—that, for instance, of cockroaches,
which are for the most part black or brown—the few species which
resort to flowers are gayly colored. What a contrast, also, between the
dark, loathsome, in-door spiders and their prettily painted green and
red, and white and yellow brethren of the fields and gardens, which
seek their prey among the flowers; while more striking still is the difference
between the wingless, disgusting plague of cities and the elegantly-formed,
brightly-colored winged bugs, which are common frequenters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of the parterre. Whether this be imputed to the effect of light,
or the breathing influence of a flowery atmosphere, and the tendency of
all things to produce their similitudes, there lies beneath the natural
fact a moral analogy applicable to ourselves.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>A volume of general selections from English rural verse
would be incomplete without some passage from Denham’s
poem of “Cooper’s Hill”—a poem so highly lauded by
past generations, and which we still read to-day with admiration.
Sir John Denham is one of those poets who have
met with very opposite treatment from critics of different
generations; after receiving the highest commendations from
Dryden, from Johnson, from Pope, from Somerville, his bays
have been very severely handled in our own time. But allowing
him to have been over-praised at one period, shall we
for that reason refuse ourselves the pleasure he is assuredly
capable of affording us? Is not “Cooper’s Hill” a fine old
poem of the second class, which the nineteenth century does
well to read once in a while? The celebrated lines, quoted a

  <h3 class='c014'>A RIVER.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>FROM “SALMONIA.”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><em>Hal.</em> I think I can promise you green meadows, shady trees, the song
of the nightingale, and a full, clear river.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Poiet.</em> This last is, in my opinion, the most poetical object in nature.
I will not fail to obey your summons. Pliny has, as well as I recollect,
compared a river to human life. I have never read the passage in his
works but I have been a hundred times struck with the analogy, particularly
amid mountain scenery. The river, small and clear at its
origin, gushes forth from rocks, falls into deep glens, and wantons and
meanders through a wild and picturesque country, nourishing only the
uncultivated tree or flower by its dew or spray. In this, its state of infancy
and youth, it may be compared to the human mind, in which
fancy and strength of imagination are predominant—it is more beautiful
than useful. When the different rills or torrents join, and descend
into the plain, it becomes slow and stately in its motions; it is applied
to move machinery, to irrigate meadows, and to bear upon its bosom the
stately barge; in this mature state it is deep, strong, useful. As it
flows on toward the sea, it loses its force and its motion, and at last, as
it were, becomes lost, and mingled with the mighty abyss of waters.</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Hal.</em> One might pursue the metaphor still further, and say that in its
origin—its thundering and foam, when it carries down clay from the
bank, and becomes impure—it resembles the youthful mind affected by
dangerous passions. And the influence of a lake, in calming and clearing
the turbid water, may be compared to the effect of reason in more
mature life, when the tranquil, deep, cool, and unimpassioned mind is
freed from its fever, its troubles, bubbles, noise, and foam. And, above
all, the sources of a river—which may be considered as belonging to the
atmosphere—and its termination in the ocean, may be regarded as imaging
the divine origin of the human mind, and its being ultimately
returned to, and lost in, the Infinite and Eternal Intelligence from which
it originally sprung.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>XVI.<br> <span class='blackletter'>Fairies.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“They inhabit the interior of green hills, chiefly those of
a conical form, on which they lead their dances by moonlight,
impressing upon the surface the marks of circles, which
sometimes appear yellow and blasted, sometimes of a deep-green
hue, and within which it is dangerous to sleep or to be
found after sunset.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are heard sedulously hammering in linns, precipices,
and rocky or cavernous situations, where, like the dwarfs
of the mines, mentioned by Georg. Agricola, they busy themselves
in imitating the actions and the various employments
of men. The brook of Beaumont, for example, which passes
in its course by numerous linns and caverns, is notorious for
being haunted by the Fairies; and the perforated and rounded
stones, which are formed by trituration in its channel, are
termed, by the vulgar, fairy-cups and dishes. A beautiful reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>is assigned by Fletcher for the fays frequenting streams
and fountains. He tells us of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>'A virtuous well, about whose flowery banks</div>
      <div class='line'>The nimble-footed Fairies dance their rounds</div>
      <div class='line'>By the pale moonshine, dipping oftentimes</div>
      <div class='line'>Their stolen children, so to make them free</div>
      <div class='line'>From dying flesh and dull mortality.’</div>
      <div class='line in44'><cite>Faithful Shepherdess.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There is upon the top of Minchmuir, a mountain in Peebleshire,
a spring called the Cheese Well, because, anciently,
those who passed that way were wont to throw into it a piece
of cheese as an offering to the Fairies, to whom it was consecrated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The usual dress of the Fairies is green, though, on the
moors, they have been sometimes observed in heath brown,
or in weeds dyed with the stoneran, or lichen. They often
ride in invisible procession, when their presence is discovered
by the shrill ringing of their bridles.”—<cite>Minstrelsy of
Scottish Border.</cite></p>

<p class='c012'>The seed of the fern, from its singular manner of growth,
was supposed to be under the especial protection of the Queen
of the Fairies. It was believed to have the quality of rendering
whoever carried it about him invisible, and to be also
of great use in charms and incantations. But the difficulties
of gathering this mysterious seed were very great indeed; it
was supposed to be only visible on St. John’s Eve, and at the
very moment when the Baptist was born. How the rustic
population accounted for the fact that it might, in reality, be
found on the fronds both before and after that day, one can not
say; but they probably held this to be a delusion of the Fairies.
It is certain, at least, that they supposed the important
magic seed itself only to be attainable on that one evening in
the year. But even at the right hour to collect this seed was
no easy task, the Fairies resorting to all kinds of devices to
prevent human hands from gathering it. A certain individual
who flattered himself that he had succeeded in his errand,
and supposed that “he had gotten a quantity of it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>secured it in papers, and in a box besides, when he came
home, found all empty.” This fancy connected with the fern
appears to have been very general. Shakspeare alludes to it:</p>

      <div class='line'>A hundred cottage fires burn bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a thousand happy faces shining</div>
      <div class='line'>In the burning blaze, and the gleam declining.</div>
      <div class='line'>I care, not I, for the stars above,</div>
      <div class='line'>The lights on earth are the lights I love;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let Venus blur the evening air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Uprise at morn Prince Lucifer;</div>
      <div class='line'>But those little tiny stars be mine</div>
      <div class='line'>That through the softened copse-wood shine.</div>
      <div class='line'>With beauty crown the pastoral hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And glimmer o’er the sylvan rill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where stands the peasant’s ivied nest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the huge mill-wheel is at rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>From out the honeysuckle’s bloom</div>
      <div class='line'>I peep’d into that laughing room,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, like a hail-drop on the pane,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pattering, I still’d the din again,</div>
      <div class='line'>While every startled eye looked up,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, half-raised to her lips the cup,</div>
      <div class='line'>The rosy maiden’s look met mine!</div>
      <div class='line'>But I vail’d mine eyes with the silken twine</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the small wild roses, clustering thickly;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then to her seat returning quickly,</div>
      <div class='line'>She 'gan to talk with bashful glee</div>
      <div class='line'>Of fairies 'neath the greenwood tree</div>
      <div class='line'>Dancing by moonlight, and she blest</div>
      <div class='line'>Gently our silent land of rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>The infants playing on the floor,</div>
      <div class='line'>At these wild words their sports gave o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ask’d where liv’d the Cottage Fairy;</div>
      <div class='line'>The maid replied, 'She loves to tarry</div>
      <div class='line'>Ofttimes beside our very hearth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And joins in little children’s mirth,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>When they are gladly innocent;</div>
      <div class='line'>And sometimes beneath the leafy tent,</div>
      <div class='line'>That murmurs round our cottage door,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our overshadowing sycamore,</div>
      <div class='line'>We see her dancing in a ring,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hear the blessed creature sing—</div>
      <div class='line'>A creature full of gentleness,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rejoicing in our happiness.’</div>
      <div class='line'>Then pluck’d I a wreath with many a gem</div>
      <div class='line'>Burning—a flowery diadem—</div>
      <div class='line'>And through the wicket, with a glide</div>
      <div class='line'>I slipped, and sat me down beside</div>
      <div class='line'>The youngest of those infants fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wreath’d the blossoms in her hair.</div>
      <div class='line'>'Who placed these flowers on William’s head?’</div>
      <div class='line'>The little wondering sister said,</div>
      <div class='line'>'A wreath not half so bright and gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crown’d me, upon the morn of May,</div>
      <div class='line'>Queen of that sunny holiday.’</div>
      <div class='line'>The tiny monarch laughed aloud</div>
      <div class='line'>With pride among the loving crowd,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, with my shrillest voice, I lent</div>
      <div class='line'>A chorus to their merriment;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then with such murmur as a bee</div>
      <div class='line'>Makes, from a flower-cup suddenly</div>
      <div class='line'>Borne off into the silent sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>I skimmed away, and with delight</div>

<h3 class='c014'>THE MEMORY OF A WALK.</h3>

<p class='c019'>I have taken, since you went away, many of the walks which we have
taken together; and none of them, I believe, without thoughts of you.
I have, though not a good memory in general, yet a good local memory,
and can recollect, by the help of a tree or a stile, what you said on that
particular spot. For this reason I purpose, when the summer is come,
to walk with a book in my pocket; what I read at my fireside I forget,
but what I read under a hedge or at the side of a pond, that pond and
that hedge will always bring to remembrance; and this is a sort of <em>memoria
technica</em> which I would recommend to you, if I did not know that
you have no occasion for it.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>One does not often meet with Shenstone’s “Schoolmistress”
now-a-days, and as every year makes her more of a
rarity, we have given her a place in our rustic group. There
appears to be no doubt that Shenstone, who learned to read
from the old dame who taught the village school at Hales-Owen,
his native hamlet, sketched from life, when he drew
the old “Schoolmistress,” her blue apron, her single hen, and
the noisy little troop about her. To us, however, in these
very different days, the simple rustic sketch assumes something
of the dignity of an historical picture.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little thatched cottage of the dame is still to be seen
near Hales-Owen, as well as the gabled roof of the Leasowes,
under which the poet was born. The old homes of England,
whether cot or castle, are seldom leveled by the hand of man,
and they long remain as links between successive generations.</p>

<p class='c012'>A few of the stanzas have been omitted, in order to bring
the poem within the limits of this volume.</p>

beaux; but at our spring clubs and associations it becomes an essential,
indispensable appointment, a little of the spirit of rivalry seeming
to animate our youths in the choice and magnitude of this adornment.
The superb spike of a Brompton, or ten-weeks’-stock long cherished in
some sheltered corner for the occasion, surrounded by all the gayety the
garden can afford, till it presents a very bush of flowers, forms the appendage
of their bosoms, and, with the gay knots in their hats, their
best garments, and the sprightly hilarity of their looks, constitutes a
pleasing village scene, and gives an hour of unencumbered felicity to
common man and rural life, not yet disturbed by refinement and taste.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>GIPSIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>We have few gipsies in our neighborhood. In spite of our tempting
green lanes, our woody dells, and heathy commons, the rogues don’t
take to us. I am afraid we are too civilized—too cautious; our sheepfolds
are too closely watched; our barn-yards are too well guarded; our
geese and ducks too fastly penned; our chickens too securely locked up;
our little pigs too safe in their sty; our game too scarce; our laundresses
too careful. In short, we are too little primitive; we have a
snug brood of vagabonds and poachers of our own, to say nothing of
their regular followers, constables and justices of the peace. We have
stocks in the village, and a tread-mill in the next town, and therefore
we go gipsy-less—a misfortune of which every landscape painter and
every lover of that living landscape, the country, can appreciate the extent.
There is nothing under the sun that harmonizes so well with nature,
especially in her woodland recesses, as that picturesque people,
who are, so to say, the wild genus—the pheasants and roebucks of the
human race.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes, indeed, we used to see a gipsy procession passing along the
common, like an Eastern caravan, men, women, children, donkeys, and
dogs; and sometimes a patch of bare earth, strewed with ashes and surrounded
by scathed turf, on the broad green margin of some cross-road,
would give token of a gipsy hall; but a regular gipsy encampment has
always been so rare an event, that I was equally surprised and delighted
to meet with one in the course of my walks last autumn.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* They
had pitched their little tent under one of the oak trees, perhaps from a
certain dim sense of natural beauty, which those who live with nature
in the fields are seldom totally without; perhaps because the neighborhood
of the coppices and of the deserted hall was favorable to the acquisition
of game, and of the little fuel which their hardy habits required.
The party consisted only of four—an old crone in a tattered
red cloak and black bonnet, who was stooping over a kettle, of which the
contents were probably as savory as that of Meg Merrilies’, renowned in
story; a pretty black-eyed girl at work under the trees; a sun-burned
urchin of eight or nine, collecting sticks and dead leaves to feed their
out-of-door fire; and a slender lad, two or three years older, who lay
basking in the sun, with a couple of shabby dogs of the sort called mongrel,
in all the joy of idleness, while a grave, patient donkey stood
grazing hard by. It was a pretty picture, with its soft autumnal sky,
its rich woodiness, its verdure, the light smoke curling from the fire,
and the group disposed around it so harmless, poor outcasts! and so
happy—a beautiful picture! The old gipsy was a celebrated fortune-teller,
and the post having been so long vacant, she could not have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>brought her talents to a better market. The whole village rang with
the predictions of this modern Cassandra—unlike her Trojan predecessor,
inasmuch as her prophecies were never of ill. I myself could not
help admiring the real cleverness and genuine gipsy tact with which she
adapted her foretellings to the age, the habits, and the known desires
and circumstances of her clients.</p>

<p class='c012'>To our little pet Lizzy, for instance, a damsel of seven, she predicted
a fairing; to Ben Kirby, a youth of thirteen, head batter of the boys, a
new cricket-ball; to his sister Lucy, a girl some three years his senior,
and just promoted to that ensign of womanhood—a cap—she promised a
pink top-knot; while for Miss Sophia Matthews, our old-maidish schoolmistress,
who would be heartily glad to be a girl again, she foresaw one
handsome husband, and for the smart widow Simmons, two. These were
the least of her triumphs. George Davis, the dashing young farmer of
the Hill-house, a gay sportsman, who scoffed at fortune-tellers and matrimony,
consulted her as to whose grayhound would win the courser’s
cup at the beacon meeting, to which she replied that she did not know
to whom the dog would belong, but that the winner of the cup would be
a white grayhound, with one blue ear and a spot on its side, being an
exact description of Mr. George Davis’ favorite Helen, who followed her
master’s step like his shadow, and was standing behind him at this very
instant. This prediction gained our gipsy half-a-crown; and Master
Welles, the thriving, thrifty yeoman of the lea, she managed to win sixpence
from his hard, honest, frugal hand, by a prophecy that his old
blood mare, called Blackfoot, should bring forth twins. And Ned, the
blacksmith, who was known to court the tall nurse-maid at the mill—she
got a shilling from Ned, simply by assuring him that his wife should
have the longest coffin that ever was made at our wheelwright’s shop:
a most tempting prediction! ingeniously combining the prospect of winning
and of surviving the lady of his heart—a promise equally adapted
to the hot and cold fits of that ague called love—lightening the fetters
of wedlock—uniting in a breath the bridegroom and the widower. Ned
was the best pleased of all her customers, and enforced his suit with
such vigor, that he and the fair giantess were asked in church the next
Sunday, and married at the fortnight’s end.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE ENGLISH COMMON.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Turning again up the hill, we find ourselves on that peculiar charm
of English scenery, a green common, divided by the road; the right side
fringed by hedge-rows and trees, with cottages and farm-houses irregularly
placed, and terminated by a double avenue of noble oaks: the left,
prettier still, dappled by bright pools of water, and islands of cottages and
cottage-gardens, and sinking gradually down to corn-fields and meadows,
and an old farm-house with pointed roofs and clustered chimneys
looking out from its blooming orchard, and backed by woody hills. The
common itself is the prettiest part of the prospect, half covered with low
furze, whose golden blossoms reflect so intensely the last beams of the
setting sun, and alive with cows and sheep, and two sets of cricketers:
one of young men, surrounded with spectators—some standing, some
stretched on the grass, all taking a delightful interest in the game: the
other a group of little boys at an humble distance, for whom even cricket
is scarcely lively enough, shouting, leaping, and enjoying themselves to
their hearts’ content.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Autumn is a favorite season with American poets; they
have taken great delight in singing the high-toned magnificence
of the season, as well as that delicacy and sweetness
of aspect which so often adds an exquisite charm to the
brilliancy of autumnal beauty under our native skies. The
poets of Europe have scarcely sung the delights of Spring
with more eloquent fervor. We can not wonder that such
should be the case; from the first tinge of peculiar coloring
to the last smile of the Indian Summer, the season is full of
interest and beauty, of ever-varying aspects. It has been
with real reluctance that we have been compelled to turn
aside from many beautiful passages of American verse which
we had originally hoped to have inserted in this division of
the volume; but fortunately they lie already within every
reader’s reach, in other forms.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>OF BUILDING.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='small'>COUNTRY HOUSES.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>He that alters an old house is tied as a translator to the original,
and is confined to the fancy of the first builder. Such a man were unwise
to pluck down good old buildings, to erect, perchance, worse new.
But those that raze a new house from the ground are blameworthy if
they make it not handsome, seeing, to them, method and confusion are
both at a rate. In building, we must respect situation, contrivance, receipt,
strength, and beauty. Of situation:</p>

<p class='c012'>Chiefly choose a wholesome air. For air is a dish one feeds on every
minute, and therefore it need be good. Wherefore great men (who may
build where they please, as poor men where they can), if herein they
prefer their profit above their health, I refer them to their physicians
to make them pay for it accordingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Wood and water are two staple commodities, where they may be had.
The former, I confess, hath made so much iron, that it must now be
bought with the more silver, and grows daily dearer. But it is as well
pleasant as profitable to see a house cased with trees, like that of Anchises,
in Troy,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<span lang="la">——quanquam secreta parentis</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Anchisæ domus arboribusque obtecta recessit.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>The worst is, where a place is bald of wood, no art can make it a periwig.
As for water, begin with Pindar’s beginning, “<span lang="grc">ἄρισον μεὺ hύὁωρ</span>.”
The fort of Gogmagog Hill, nigh Cambridge, is counted impregnable,
but for water; the mischief of many houses, where the servants must
bring the water on their shoulders.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next, a pleasant prospect is to be respected. A medley view (such as
of water and land at Greenwich) best entertains the eye, refreshing the
wearied beholder with exchange of objects. Yet I know a more profitable
prospect, where the owner can only see his own land round about.</p>

<p class='c012'>A fair entrance, with an easy ascent, gives a great grace to a building,
where the hall is a preferment out of the court, the parlor out of
the hall; not (as in some old buildings) where the doors are so low,
pigmies must stoop, and the rooms so high that giants may stand upright.
But now we are come to the contrivance:</p>

<p class='c012'>Let not thy common rooms be several, nor thy several rooms be common.
The hall (which is a pandocheum) ought to lie open, and so ought
passages and stairs (provided that the whole house be not spent in paths);
chambers and closets are to be private and retired.</p>

<p class='c012'>Light (God’s eldest daughter) is a principal beauty in a building; yet
it shines not alike from all parts of heaven. An east window welcomes
the infant beams of the sun before they are of strength to do any harm,
and is offensive to none but a sluggard. A south window in summer is
a chimney with a fire in it, and needs the screen of a curtain. In a west
window in summer time, toward night, the sun grows low and over-familiar,
with more light than delight. A north window is best for butteries
and cellars, where the beer will be sour for the sun’s smiling on
it. Thorough-lights are best for rooms of entertainment, and windows
on one side for dormitories. As for receipt:</p>

<p class='c012'>A house had better be too little for a day than too great for a year.
And it is easier borrowing of thy neighbor a brace of chambers for a
night, than a bag of money for a twelvemonth. It is vain, therefore, to
proportion the receipt to an extraordinary occasion, as those who, by
over-building their houses have dilapidated their lands, and their estates
have been pressed to death under the weight of their house. As for
strength:</p>

<p class='c012'>Country houses must be substantives, able to stand of themselves;
not like city buildings, supported by their neighbors on either side. By
strength we mean such as may resist weather and time, not invasion—castles
being out of date in this peaceable age. As for the making of
moats round about, it is questionable whether the fogs be not more unhealthful
than the fish bring profit, or the water defense. Beauty remains
behind, as the last to be regarded, because houses are made to be
lived in, not looked on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let not the front look asquint on a stranger, but accost him right at
his entrance. Uniformity, also, much pleaseth the eye; and it is observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>that freestone, like a fair complexion, soonest waxeth old, while
brick keeps her beauty longest.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let the office-houses observe the due distance from the mansion-house.
Those are too familiar which presume to be of the same pile with it.
The same may be said of stables and barns; without which a house is
like a city without outworks, it can never hold out long.</p>

<p class='c012'>Gardens, also, are to attend in their place. When God (Genesis ii. 9)
planted a garden eastward, He made to grow out of the ground every
tree pleasant to the sight, and good for food. Sure He knew better what
was proper to a garden than those, who, now-a-days, therein only feed
the eyes, and starve both taste and smell.</p>

<p class='c012'>To conclude. In building, rather believe any man than an artificer
in his own art for matter of charges; not that they can not, but will
not, be faithful. Should they tell thee all the cost at the first, it would
blast a young builder in the budding, and therefore they sooth thee up
till it hath cost thee something to confute them. The spirit of building
first possessed people after the flood, which then caused the confusion of
languages, and since, the estate of many a man.</p>

<div class='c017'><span class='sc'>Thomas Fuller</span>, “<cite>Holy and Profane States</cite>,” 1608–1661.</div>

<h3 class='c014'>OF BUILDING.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Houses are built to live in, and not to look on; therefore let use be
preferred before uniformity, except where both may be had. Leave the
goodly fabrics of houses, for beauty only, to the enchanted palaces of the
poets, who build them with small cost. He that buildeth a fair house
upon an ill seat, committeth himself to prison; neither do I reckon it an
ill seat only where the air is unwholesome, but likewise where the air is
unequal; as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of ground,
environed with higher hills round about it, whereby the heat of the sun
is pent in, and the wind gathereth as in troughs; so as you shall have,

in several places. Neither is it ill air only that maketh an ill seat, but
ill ways, ill markets; and if you will consult with Momus, ill neighbors.
I speak not of many more; want of water, want of wood, shade, and
shelter, want of fruitfulness, and mixture of grounds of several natures;
want of prospect, want of level grounds, want of places at some near
distance for sports of hunting, hawking, and races; too near the sea, or
too remote; having the commodity of navigable rivers, or the discommodity
of their overflowing; too far from great cities, which may hinder
business; or too near them, which lurcheth all provisions, and maketh
every thing dear; where a man hath a great living laid together and
where he is scanted; all which, as it is impossible perhaps to find together,
so it is good to know them, and think of them, that a man may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>like as many as he can; and, if he have several dwellings, that he sod
them so, that what he wanteth in one he may find in another. Lucullus
answered Pompey well, who, when he saw his stately galleries, and rooms
so large and lightsome, in one of his houses, said, “Surely an excellent
place for summer, but how do you in winter?” Lucullus answered,
“Why do you not think me as wise as some fowls, that ever change
their abode toward the winter?”</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>A SPORTSMAN OF OLDEN TIME.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>I shall conclude this account of the officers of the forest with the singular
character of one of them who lived in the times of James I. and
Charles I.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c012'>The name of this memorable sportsman—for in that character alone
was he conspicuous—was Henry Hastings. He was second son to the
Earl of Huntingdon, and inherited a good estate in Dorsetshire from his
mother. He was one of the keepers of New Forest, and resided in his
lodge there during a part of every hunting-season. But his principal
residence was at Woodlands, in Dorsetshire, where he had a capital
mansion. One of his nearest neighbors was Anthony Cooper, afterward
Earl of Shaftesbury. Two men could not be more opposite in their
dispositions and pursuits. They seldom saw each other, and their occasional
meetings were still more disagreeable to both, from their opposite
sentiments in politics. Lord Shaftesbury, who was the younger man,
was the survivor; and the following account of Mr. Hastings, which I
have somewhat abridged, is said to have been the production of his
pen. If Mr. Hastings had been the survivor, and had lived to have seen
Lord Shaftesbury one of the infamous ministers of Charles II., he might,
with interest, have returned the compliment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Hastings was low of stature, but strong and active; of a ruddy
complexion, with flaxen hair. His clothes were always of green cloth.
His house was of the old fashion, in the midst of a large park, well
stocked with deer, rabbits, and fish-ponds. He had a long, narrow
bowling-green in it, and used to play with round sand-bowls. Here,
too, he had a banqueting-room built, like a stand, in a large tree. He
kept all sorts of hounds that ran buck, fox, hare, otter, and badger;
and had hawks of all kinds, both long and short winged. His great
hall was commonly strewed with marrow-bones, and full of hawk-perches,
hounds, spaniels, and terriers; the upper end of it was hung with
fox-skins of this and the last year’s killing. Here and there a polecat
was intermixed, and hunters’ poles in great abundance. The parlor was
a large room, completely furnished in the same style. On a broad hearth,
paved with brick, lay some of the choicest terriers, hounds, and spaniels.
One or two of the great chairs had litters of cats in them, which
were not to be disturbed. Of these, three or four always attended him
at dinner, and a little white wand lay by his trencher to defend it if
they were too troublesome. In the windows—which were very large—lay
his arrows, cross-bows, and other accoutrements. The corners of
the room were filled with his best hunting and hawking poles. His oyster-table
stood at the lower end of the room, which was in constant use
twice a day, all the year round, for he never failed to eat oysters, both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>at dinner and supper, with which the neighboring town of Pool supplied
him. At the upper end of the room stood a small table with a double
desk, one side of which held a church Bible, the other the Book of Martyrs.
On different tables in the room lay hawk’s-hoods; bells; old hats,
with their crowns thrust in, full of pheasant eggs; tables; dice; cards;
and a store of tobacco-pipes. At one end of this room was a door which
opened into a closet, where stood bottles of strong beer and wine, which
never came out but in single glasses, which was the rule of the house;
for he never exceeded himself, nor permitted others to exceed. Answering
to this closet was a door into an old chapel—which had been long
disused—for devotion: but in the pulpit, at the safest place, was always
to be found a cold shin of beef, a venison pasty, a gammon of bacon, or
a great apple-pie, with thick crust, well baked. His table cost him not
much, though it was good to eat at. His sports supplied all but beef
and mutton, except on Fridays, when he had the best of fish. He never
wanted a London pudding; and he always sang it in with “My part lies
therein—a—.” He drank a glass or two of wine at meals, put syrup
of gilliflowers into his sack, and had always a tun-glass of small beer
standing by him, which he often stirred about with rosemary. He lived
to be an hundred, and never lost his eyesight, nor used spectacles. He
got on horseback without help, and rode to the death of the stag till past
fourscore.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LETTER OF SIR THOMAS MORE TO HIS WIFE.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Mistress Alice, in my most heartywise I recommend me to you. And
whereas I am informed by my son Heron of the loss of our barns and our
neighbours’ also, with all the corn that was therein; albeit (saving God’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>pleasure) it is great pity of so much good corn lost; yet since it has
liked him to send us such a chance, we must and are bounden, not only
to be content, but also to be glad of his visitation. He sent us all that
we have lost; and since he hath by such a chance taken it away again,
his pleasure be fulfilled! Let us never grudge thereat, but take it in
good worth, and heartily thank him, as well for adversity as for prosperity.
And peradventure we have more cause to thank him for our
loss than for our winning, for his wisdom better seeth what is good for
us than we do ourselves. Therefore, I pray you be of good cheer, and
take all the household with you to church, and there thank God, both
for that he has given us, and for that he has taken from us, and for
that he hath left us; which, if it please him, he can increase when he
will, and if it please him to leave us yet less, at his pleasure be it!</p>

<p class='c012'>I pray you to make some good onsearch what my poor neighbours have
lost, and bid them make no thought therefor; for, if I should not leave
myself a spoon, there shall no poor neighbour of mine bear no loss by
my chance, happened in my house. I pray you be, with my children
and your household, merry in God; and devise somewhat with your
friends what way were best to take, for provision to be made for corn
for our household, and for seed this year coming, if we think it good
that we keep the ground still in our hands. And whether we think it
good that we so shall do or not, yet I think it were not best suddenly
thus to leave it all up, and to put away our folk from our farm, till we
have somewhat advised us thereon. Howbeit, if we have more now than
ye shall need, and which can get them other masters, ye may then discharge
us of them. But I would not that any man were suddenly sent
away, he wot not whither.</p>

<p class='c012'>At my coming hither, I perceived none other but that I should tarry
still with the king’s grace. But now I shall, I think, because of this
chance, get leave this next week to come home and see you, and then
shall we farther devise together upon all things, what order shall be best
to take.</p>

<p class='c012'>And thus as heartily fare you well, with all our children, as ye can
wish. At Woodstock, the third day of September, by the hand of</p>

      <div class='line'>Mid the high bleak moors of Saarijärvis,</div>
      <div class='line'>On a sterile farm, lived peasant Pavo,</div>
      <div class='line'>And its poor soil tilled with care untiring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trusting to the Lord to send the increase.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here he lived with wife and little children,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>With them of sweat-earned bread partaking.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dikes he dug, and plowed his land and sowed it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Spring-time came, and now the melting snow-drifts</div>
      <div class='line'>Drenched the fields, and half the young crop perished;</div>
      <div class='line'>Summer came, and the descending hail-storms</div>
      <div class='line'>Dashed the early ears down, half destroying;</div>
      <div class='line'>Autumn came, and frosts the remnant blasted.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Pavo’s wife she tore her hair, and spake thus:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Pavo, Pavo! man the most unhappy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Take thy staff; by God we are forsaken;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hard it is to beg, to starve is harder!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Pavo took her hand, and thus he answered:</div>
      <div class='line'>“God doth try his servant, not forsake him;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bread made half of bark must now suffice us!</div>
      <div class='line'>I will dig the dikes of two-fold deepness;</div>
      <div class='line'>But from God will I await the increase!”</div>
      <div class='line'>She made bread of corn and bark together;</div>
      <div class='line'>He dug lower dikes with double labor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sold his sheep, and purchased rye and sowed it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Spring-time came, again the melting snow-drifts</div>
      <div class='line'>Drenched the fields, and half the young crop perished;</div>
      <div class='line'>Summer came, and the descending hail-storms</div>
      <div class='line'>Dashed the early ears down, half destroying;</div>
      <div class='line'>Autumn came, and frosts the remnant blasted.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Pavo’s wife she smote her breast, exclaiming:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Pavo, Pavo! man the most unhappy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let us die, for God hath us forsaken:</div>
      <div class='line'>Hard it is to die, to live is harder!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Pavo took her hand, and thus he answered:</div>
      <div class='line'>“God doth try his servant, not forsake him;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bread made half of bark must still suffice us!</div>
      <div class='line'>I will dig the dikes of double deepness;</div>
      <div class='line'>But from Heaven I will expect the increase!”</div>
      <div class='line'>She made bread of corn and bark together;</div>
      <div class='line'>He dug lower dikes with double labor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sold his cattle, purchased rye and sowed it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Spring-time came, but now the melting snow-drifts</div>
      <div class='line'>Left the young crops in the fields uninjured;</div>
      <div class='line'>Summer came, but the descending hail-storms</div>
      <div class='line'>Dashed not down the rich ears, naught destroying;</div>
      <div class='line'>Autumn came, and saw, by frosts unblighted,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wave the golden harvest for the reaper.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Then fell Pavo on his knees, thus speaking:</div>
      <div class='line'>“God hath only tried us, not forsaken!”</div>
      <div class='line'>On her knees his wife fell, and thus said she:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>“God hath only tried us, not forsaken!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And then gladly spake she to her husband:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Pavo, Pavo! take with joy the sickle,</div>
      <div class='line'>We may now make glad our hearts with plenty,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now may throw away the bark unsavory,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bake rich, sweet bread of rye-meal only!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Pavo took her hand in his, and answered:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Woman, woman! ’tis but sent to try us,</div>
      <div class='line'>If we will have pity on the sufferer.</div>

</div>

<div class='c017'><span class='sc'>St. John’s, New Brunswick</span>, <em>July 8, 1788</em>.</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>My dearest Mother</span>—Here I am, after a very long and fatiguing
journey. I had no idea of what it was; it was more like a campaign
than anything else, except in one material point, that of having no
danger. I should have enjoyed it most completely but for the musquitoes,
but they took off a great deal of my pleasure; the millions of
them are dreadful; if it had not been for this inconvenience, my journey
would have been delightful. The country is almost all in a state of
nature, as well as its inhabitants. There are four sorts of these—the
Indians, the French, the old English settlers, and now the refugees from
other parts of America; the last seem the most civilized. The old settlers
are almost as wild as Indians, but lead a very comfortable life;
they are all farmers, and live entirely within themselves.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*
I came by a settlement along one of the rivers, which was all the work
of one pair; the old man was seventy-two, the old lady seventy; they
had been there thirty years; they came there with one cow, three children,
and one servant; there was not a being within sixty miles of
them. The first year they lived mostly on milk and marsh leaves; the
second year they contrived to purchase a bull by the produce of their
moose skins and fish; from this time they got on very well; and there
are now five sons and a daughter, all settled in different farms along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>river for the space of twenty miles, and all living comfortably and at
ease. The old pair live alone in the little old cabin they first settled in,
two miles from any of their children; their little spot of ground is cultivated
by these children, and they are supplied with so much butter,
grain, meal, etc., from each child, according to the share he got of the
land, so that the old folks have nothing to do but to mind their house,
which is a kind of inn they keep, more for the sake of the company of
the few travelers there are than for gain. I was obliged to stay a day
with the old people, on account of the tides, which did not answer for
going up the river till next morning. It was, I think, as odd and pleasant
a day, in its way, as ever I passed. I wish I could describe it to
you, but I can not; you must only help it out with your own imagination.
Conceive, dearest mother, arriving about twelve o’clock in a hot
day, at a little cabin upon the side of a rapid river, the banks all covered
with wood, not a house in sight, and there finding a little, clean,
tidy woman spinning, with an old man, of the same appearance, weeding
salad. We had come for ten miles up the river without seeing any
thing but woods. The old pair, on our arrival, got as active as if only
five-and-twenty, the gentleman getting wood and water, the lady frying
eggs and bacon, both talking a great deal, telling their story, as I
mentioned before, how they had been there thirty years, and how their
children were settled, and, when either’s back was turned, remarking
how old the other had grown; at the same time all kindness, all cheerfulness,
and love to each other. The contrast of all this, which had
passed during the day, with the quietness of the evening, when the
spirits of the old people had a little subsided and began to wear off with
the day, and with the fatigue of their little work, sitting quietly at their
door, on the same spot they had lived in thirty years together; the contented
thoughtfulness of their countenances, which was increased by
their age and the solitary life they had led; the wild quietness of the
place—not a living creature or habitation to be seen—and me, Tony,
and our guide, sitting with them, all on one log; the difference of the
scene I had left—the immense way I had to get from this corner of the
world to any thing I loved—the difference of the life I should lead from
that of this old pair, perhaps at their age discontented, disappointed,
and miserable, wishing for power—my dearest mother, if it was not
for you, I believe I never should go home, at least I thought so at that
moment. However, here I am with my regiment, up at six in the morning
doing all sorts of right things, and liking it very much, determined
to go home next spring, and live with you a great deal. Employment
keeps up my spirits, and I shall have more every day. I own I often
think how happy I should be with G——, in some of the spots I see;
and envied every young farmer I met whom I saw sitting down with a
young wife whom he was going to work to maintain. I believe these
thoughts made my journey pleasanter than it otherwise would have
been; but I don’t give way to them here. Dearest mother, I sometimes
hope it will all end well; but shall not think any more of it till I hear
from England. *  *  *  *  *  *  *</p>

<p class='c012'>It has pleased God to give us rain, without which this part of our
country, at least, must soon have become a desert. The meadows have
been parched to a January brown, and we have foddered our cattle for
some time, as in winter. The goodness and power of God are never, I
believe, so universally acknowledged as at the end of a long drought.
Man is naturally a self-sufficient animal, and in all concerns that seem
to lie within the sphere of his own ability thinks little or not at all of
the need he always has of protection and furtherance from above. But
he is sensible that the clouds will not assemble at his bidding; and that,
though the clouds assemble, they will not fall in showers because he
commands them. When, therefore, at last the blessing descends, you
shall hear even in the streets the most irreligious and thoughtless with
one voice exclaim, “Thank God!” confessing themselves indebted to his
favor, and willing, at least so far as words go, to give Him the glory. I
can hardly doubt, therefore, that the earth is sometimes parched, and
the crops endangered, in order that the multitude may not want a memento
to whom they owe them, nor absolutely forget the power on which
all depend for all things.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>THE HURRICANE.</h3>

<p class='c019'>I had left the village of Shawaney, situated on the banks of the Ohio, on
my return to Henderson, which is also situated on the banks of the same
beautiful stream. The weather was pleasant, and I thought not warmer
than usual at that season. My horse was jogging quietly along, and my
thoughts were for once, at least, in the course of my life, entirely engaged
in commercial speculations. I had forded Highland Creek, and
was on the eve of entering a tract of bottom-land, or valley that lay between
it and Canoe Creek, when on a sudden I remarked a great difference
in the aspect of the heavens. A hazy thickness had overspread the
country, and I for some time expected an earthquake, but my horse exhibited
no propensity to stop and prepare for such an occurrence. I had
nearly arrived at the verge of the valley, when I thought fit to stop near
a brook, and dismounted to quench the thirst which had come
upon me.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was leaning on my knees, with my lips about to touch the water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>when, from my proximity to the earth, I heard a distant murmuring
sound of an extraordinary nature; I drank, however, and as I rose on
my feet, looked toward the southwest, where I observed a yellowish,
oval spot, the appearance of which was quite new to me. Little time
was left me for consideration, as the next moment a smart breeze began
to agitate the taller trees. It increased to an unexpected height, and
already the smaller branches and twigs were seen falling in a slanting
direction toward the ground. Two minutes had scarcely elapsed, when
the whole forest before me was in fearful motion. Here and there,
where one tree pressed against another, a creaking noise was produced,
similar to that occasioned by the violent gusts which sometimes sweep
over the country. Turning instinctively toward the direction from
which the wind blew, I saw, to my great astonishment, that the noblest
trees of the forest bent their lofty heads for a while, and, unable to stand
against the blast, were falling into pieces. First, the branches were
broken off with a crackling noise; then went the upper part of the massy
trunks, and in many places whole trees of gigantic size were falling entire
to the ground. So rapid was the progress of the storm, that before
I could think of taking measures to insure my safety, the hurricane was
passing opposite to the place where I stood. Never can I forget the
scene which at that moment presented itself. The tops of the trees were
seen moving in the strangest manner, in the central current of the tempest,
which carried along with it a mingled mass of twigs and foliage,
that completely obscured the view. Some of the largest trees were seen
bending and writhing under the gale; others suddenly snapped across,
and many, after a momentary resistance, fell uprooted to the earth.
The mass of branches, twigs, foliage, and dust that moved through the
air, was whirled onward like a cloud of feathers, and, on passing, disclosed
a wide space filled with fallen trees, naked stumps, and heaps of
shapeless ruins, which marked the path of the tempest. This space was
about a fourth of a mile in breadth, and to my imagination resembled
the dried-up bed of the Mississippi, with its thousands of <em>planters</em> and
<em>sawyers</em> strewed in the sand, and inclined in various degrees. The
horrible noise resembled that of the great cataracts of Niagara; and as
it howled along in the track of the desolating tempest, produced a feeling
in my mind which it is impossible to describe.</p>

<p class='c012'>The principal force of the hurricane was now over, although millions
of twigs and small branches, that had been brought from a great distance,
were seen following the blast, as if drawn onward by some mysterious
power. They even floated in the air for some hours after, as if
supported by the thick mass of dust that rose high above the ground.
The sky had now a greenish, lurid hue, and an extremely disagreeable
sulphureous odor was diffused in the atmosphere. I waited in amazement,
having sustained no material injury, until nature at length resumed
her wonted aspect. For some moments I felt undetermined
whether I should return to Morgantown, or attempt to force my way
through the wrecks of the tempest. My business, however, being of an
urgent nature, I ventured into the path of the storm, and after encountering
innumerable difficulties, succeeded in crossing it. I was obliged
to lead my horse by the bridle to enable him to leap over the fallen
trees, while I scrambled over or under them in the best way I could—at
times so hemmed in by the broken tops and tangled branches, as almost
to become desperate. On arriving at my house, I gave an account of
what I had seen, when, to my surprise, I was told there had been very
little wind in the neighborhood, although in the streets and gardens
many branches and twigs had fallen in a manner which excited great
surprise.</p>

and bushes, thickly entangled amid the tops and trunks of the fallen
trees, and is the resort of ravenous animals, to which they betake themselves,
when pursued by man, or after they have committed their depredations
on the farms of the surrounding district. I have crossed the
path of the storm at a distance of a hundred miles from the spot where I
witnessed its fury, and again four hundred miles farther off, in the State
of Ohio. Lastly, I observed traces of its ravages on the summits of the
mountains connected with the Great Pine Forest of Pennsylvania, three
hundred miles beyond the place last mentioned. In all these different
parts it appeared to me not to have exceeded a quarter of a mile in
breadth.</p>

      <div class='line'>And I will pay all, Heaven helping! We now are sustained</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone on bark bread!”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Again they turned into the house, no answer vouchsafing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then hastily stripped from the walls our poor store of household utensils,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seized all that remained of our clothing, and carried them off to their sledge.</div>
      <div class='line'>Weeping, my wife lay, my excellent wife, on her straw bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Watching in silence the men, and all the while soothing the baby,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which lay on her bosom new-born, and kept up a wailing of sorrow.</div>
      <div class='line'>I followed them out as they bore thence the last of our chattels,</div>
      <div class='line'>As stern in my mood as the pine when his axe at its roots lays the woodman.</div>
      <div class='line'>They cast up the worth of their plunder, and said that it reached not</div>
      <div class='line'>The half of the sum that they needed. Again spake the bailiff:</div>
      <div class='line'>“Friend,” said he, “this doth not suffice, but thou hast much kine in the cow-shed.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus saying, with no more ado, they went on to the straw-yard,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where stood the kine under their shelter lowing for fodder.</div>
      <div class='line'>They loosened and drove them all forth, one after another;</div>
      <div class='line'>Still forcing them on by compulsion, unwilling to leave their old homestead.</div>
      <div class='line'>In this way six cows were secured; the seventh, a starveling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dead rather than living, they left me. Thus all that I had was distrained on.</div>
      <div class='line'>I spake not; in dreary despondence re-crossing my threshold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus from the bed of her sorrow a low voice of misery accosts me;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Look around if thou canst not find aught for my hunger’s appeasing;</div>
      <div class='line'>How sweet were a draught of new milk, for I thirst, and the babe findeth nothing!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus spake she; a darkness came over my eyesight, and sorrowing</div>
      <div class='line'>I went to the cow-shed, where stood the lean, famishing creature,</div>
      <div class='line'>And chewed a poor mouthful of rye-straw. I pressed the dry udder,</div>
      <div class='line'>For milk trying vainly, for not a drop answered the pressure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Despairing, yet dreading a failure, yet harder assayed I,</div>
      <div class='line'>And blood flowed, a crimson stream, staining the pail of the milker.</div>
      <div class='line'>As fierce as the mother-bear, struck by the spear of the hunter,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rushed I indoors, and took up a loaf, which I sundered</div>
      <div class='line'>By the stroke of the axe, and black flew the bark-fragments round me.</div>
      <div class='line'>One morsel I gave to my wife, saying: “Take it; ’tis all that is left us;</div>
      <div class='line'>Eat, and give suck to the infant.” She took the dry morsel;</div>
      <div class='line'>She turned it about in her hand, looked at it, then pressing</div>
      <div class='line'>The babe to her bosom, she swooning, fell back on her pillow.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I buckled the skates on my feet, and sped in all haste to the neighbor</div>
      <div class='line'>Who dwelt nearest to me, and prayed for some help in my sorrow</div>
      <div class='line'>He willingly gave it, dividing his all as a brother.</div>
      <div class='line'>Again I sped back with a pailful of milk on my shoulder;</div>
      <div class='line'>But on reaching my threshold a cry of sad sorrow assailed me;</div>
      <div class='line'>And entering, I saw by the bedside my two eldest children,</div>
      <div class='line'>Frantic with terror, and trying to waken their mother;</div>
      <div class='line'>But silent and motionless lay she, a ghastly death pallor</div>
      <div class='line'>Spread over her face, and the blackness of night her eyes vailing.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This was the crown of our sorrow—bereaved was the beautiful Kangas.</div>
      <div class='line'>And ere long, as if Heaven-abandoned, I left it forever,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, taking my staff in my hand went forth, drawing my children</div>
      <div class='line'>On a light sledge behind me, and wandered gray-headed a beggar.</div>
      <div class='line'>From parish to parish we wandered, and God and good Christians sustained us.</div>
      <div class='line'>But Time doth lighten most sorrows; and now amid strangers</div>
      <div class='line'>My children are blooming afresh; for myself it contents me</div>
      <div class='line'>If only my bread I can win, and playing my jew’s-harp</div>
      <div class='line'>Can sit 'neath the trees in the sunshine, and sing like a cricket.</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Several translations from pleasing verses of Charles,
Duke of Orleans, have been inserted in this volume; and
as the American reader is seldom very familiar with French
poets, we shall venture to give a little sketch of their author.
Charles d’Orleans was born in 1391, and his life was highly
colored by the vicissitudes of that stormy period. He was a
nephew of the unhappy Charles VI., and was still a mere lad
when, in 1406, his father Louis, Duke of Orleans, and regent
of the kingdom, was assassinated in the streets of Paris, an
event which placed the youth at once in nominal possession
of his father’s duchy. The crime was laid at the door of
John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy; and the widowed
princess, Valentine Visconti, urged doubtless by the nobles of
her political party, sought every possible means of bringing
the offender to punishment; a criminal suit, extraordinary in
its details, stands recorded in the French annals in connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>with this circumstance. In order to excite the public sympathies
to the utmost, the widowed duchess, with her children,
appeared repeatedly in the streets, and courts of justice,
in gloomy mourning procession. On all these occasions the
young duke held a prominent position at the side of his Italian
mother. His father’s murderer and kinsman, however,
was too powerful for legal punishment; a few years later
he fell under the dagger of the assassin on the bridge of
Montereau, and in the presence of the dauphin. The consequences
of these crimes were ruinous to France; the powerful
house of Burgundy, after the murder of Duke John, rose
in open rebellion, and Henry V. of England, through their
means, obtained what without them he would scarcely have
dared seriously to aim at—possession of the throne of St.
Louis. On the famous field of Agincourt, Charles d’Orleans,
sharing the fate of so many others, was made prisoner. He
was immediately sent to England, where his captivity and
exile were prolonged through a period of nearly five and
twenty years, and varied only by removals from one stronghold
to another. During part of that time he was confined in
Pontrefact Castle, where his cousin, Queen Katherine, the
wife of Henry V., paid him a visit in one of her progresses.
Captivity, as in the case of several other royal and princely
exiles, led him to seek consolation and amusement from
poetical composition. His verses are very pleasing indeed,
full of the simplicity of natural feeling, with much ease and
grace of expression. Absence does not appear to have diminished
his love of country; he cherished a longing desire to
return to France, and envied, as he tells us, even the birds
which were flying toward his native shores. At length, after
a captivity extending over half a lifetime, he was liberated,
and returned to France. Having some claims upon the Duchy
of Milan, through his mother, a Visconti, he raised troops, not
long after his return to Paris, and led an expedition into Italy,
but failed to conquer the ducal crown. He was more successful
as a poet than as a soldier; but he left, however,
a reputation superior to either of these distinctions, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>of a good and honest man. His death took place in the
year 1461.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of Orleans, who figures in Shakspeare’s drama
of Henry V. at the battle of Agincourt, was this same poet-prince.
His character is not unworthily sketched in the
play, where he appears loyal and brave, superior to the other
French princes figuring in the same scenes. When the
French are already in full flight, he exclaims:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We are enough yet living in the field</div>
      <div class='line'>To smother up the English in our throngs,</div>
      <div class='line'>If any order might be thought upon.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To which the Duke of Bourbon is made to reply, very expressively:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The devil take order now! I’ll to the throng;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let life be short, else shame will be too long.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Shakspeare was probably not aware that the duke was a
poet, else he would doubtless have made an allusion to the
fact in Act iii., Scene vii., where some pleasantry occurs
between the dauphin and his companions regarding a sonnet
he had himself written to his horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is night, I am alone; forlorn on the hill of storms. The wind is
heard on the mountain. The torrent pours down the rock. No hut receives
me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of winds!</p>

<p class='c012'>Rise, moon! from behind thy clouds. Stars of the night, arise! Lead
me, some light, to the place where my love rests from the chase alone!
his bow near him unstrung; his dogs panting 'round him. But here I
must sit alone by the rock of the mossy stream. The stream and the
wind roar aloud. I hear not the voice of my love! Why delays my
Salgar—why the chief of the hill his promise? Here is the rock, and
there the tree! Here is the roaring stream! Thou didst promise with
night to be here. Ah! whither is Salgar gone? With thee I would fly
from my father; with thee from my brother of pride. Our race have
long been foes; we are not foes, O Salgar!</p>

<p class='c012'>Cease a little while, O wind! Stream, be thou silent awhile! Let my
voice be heard around. Let my wanderer hear me! Salgar, it is Colma
who calls. Here is the tree and the rock. Salgar, my love! I am
here. Why delayest thou thy coming? Lo, the calm moon comes forth.
The flood is bright in the vale. The rocks are gray on the steep; I see
him not on the brow. His dogs come not before him with tidings of his
near approach. Here I must sit alone!</p>

<p class='c012'>Who lie on the heath beside me? Are they my love, and my brother?
Speak to me, O my friends! To Colma they give no reply. Speak to
me; I am alone! My soul is tormented with fears! Ah! they are
dead! Their swords are red from the fight. O my brother! my brother!
why hast thou slain my Salgar? Why, O Salgar, hast thou slain
my brother? Dear were ye both to me! What shall I say in your
praise? Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands! He was terrible
in the fight! Speak to me; hear my voice; hear me, sons of my love!
They are silent; silent forever! Cold, cold are their breasts of clay!
Oh! from the rock on the hill—from the top of the windy steep, speak,
ye ghosts of the dead! speak, I will not be afraid! Whither are ye gone
to rest? In what cave of the hill shall I find the departed? No feeble
voice is on the gale; no answer half-drowned in the storm!</p>

<p class='c012'>I sit in my grief; I wait for morning in my tears! Rear the tomb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>ye friends of the dead. Close it not till Colma come. My life flies away
like a dream; why should I stay behind? Here shall I rest with my
friends, by the stream of the sounding rock. When night comes on the
hill; when the loud winds arise, my ghost shall stand in the blast, and
mourn the death of my friends. The hunter shall hear from his booth.
He shall fear but love my voice! For sweet shall my voice be for my
friends: pleasant were her friends to Colma!</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe I may at last flatter myself with having found the end of my
wanderings. The hopes of being united with thee—or, I should rather
say, my dreams, for hopes have been justly termed the waking dreams
of men—have remained unfulfilled. God has suffered me to find a place,
such as has often flitted before our imaginations; for that which fancy
has shown us from afar is now made manifest to me. A high mountain,
clothed with thick woods, is watered to the north by fresh and everflowing
streams. At its foot lies an extended plain, rendered fruitful
by the vapors with which it is moistened. The surrounding forest
crowded with trees of different kinds, incloses one as in a strong fortress.
This wilderness is bounded by two deep ravines; on the one side
the river, rushing in foam down the mountain, forms an almost impassable
barrier, while on the other all access is impeded by a broad
mountain-ridge. My hut is so situated on the summit of the mountain,
that I can overlook the whole plain, and follow throughout its course the
Iris, which is more beautiful, and has a more abundant body of water
than the Strymon, near Amphipolis. The river of my wilderness, which
is more impetuous than any other that I know of, breaks against the
jutting rock, and throws itself foaming into the abyss below—an object
of admiration to the mountain wanderer, and a source of profit to the
natives from the numerous fishes that are found in its waters. Shall I
describe to thee the fructifying vapors that rise from the moist earth, or
the cool breezes wafted over the rippled face of the waters? Shall I
speak of the sweet song of the birds, or of the rich luxuriance of the
flowering plants? What charms me beyond all else is the calm repose
of the spot. It is only visited occasionally by huntsmen; for my wilderness
nourishes herds of deer and wild goats, but not bears and wolves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>What other spot could I exchange for this? Alcmæon, when he had
found the Echinades, would not wander farther.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I see every ledge of rock, every valley and plain, covered with
new-born verdure, the varied beauty of the trees, and the lilies at my
feet decked by Nature with the double charms of perfume and of color,
when in the distance I see the ocean, toward which the clouds are borne
onward, my spirit is overpowered by a sadness not wholly devoid of enjoyment.
When in autumn the fruits have passed away, the leaves
have fallen, and the branches of the trees, dried and shriveled, are
robbed of their leafy adornments, we are instinctively led, amid the
everlasting and regular change in Nature, to feel the harmony of the
wondrous powers pervading all things. He who contemplates them with
the eye of the soul, feels the littleness of man amid the greatness of the
universe.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Perhaps there is no more impressive scene on earth than the solitary
extent of the Campagna of Rome under evening light. Let the reader
imagine himself for a moment withdrawn from the sounds and motion
of the living world, and sent forth alone into this wild and wasted plain.
The earth yields and crumbles beneath his foot, tread he never so lightly,
for its substance is white, hollow, and carious, like the dusty wreck of
the bones of men. The long, knotted grass waves and tosses feebly in
the evening wind, and the shadows of its motion shake feverishly along
the banks of rivers that lift themselves to the sunlight. Hillocks of
moldering earth heave around him, as if the dead beneath were struggling
in their sleep; scattered blocks of black stone, four square, remnants
of mighty edifices, not one left upon another, lie upon them to
keep them down. A dull purple, poisonous haze stretches level along
the desert, vailing its spectral wrecks of massy ruins, on whose rents
the red light rests like dying fire on defiled altars. The blue ridge of
the Alban mount lifts itself against a solemn space of green, clear, quiet
sky. Watch-towers of dark clouds stand steadfastly along the promontories
of the Apennines. From the plain to the mountains, the shattered
aqueducts, pier beyond pier, melt into the darkness, like shadowy
and countless troops of funeral mourners passing from a nation’s grave.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>An interesting passage from Hesiod is given below. The
extract is taken from the “Works and Days,” a poem
giving instructions regarding agriculture, trade, and labor,
blended with precepts of a moral character; and, in addition
to the extremely remote date of its origin, the passage is also
remarkable as one of the few instances in which a poet of
the old heathen world has entered into detail of description
on natural subjects. Its authenticity is, I believe, admitted.
“The picturesque description given by Hesiod of Winter
bears all the evidences of great antiquity,” says a learned
German critic.</p>

<p class='c019'>If there were beings who lived in the depths of the earth, in dwellings
adorned with statues and paintings, and every thing which is
possessed in rich abundance by those whom we esteem fortunate; and
if these beings could receive tidings of the power and might of the gods,
and could then emerge from their hidden dwellings through the open
fissures of the earth, to the places which we inhabit; if they could suddenly
behold the earth, and the sea, and the vault of heaven; could
recognize the expanse of the cloudy firmament, and the might of the
winds of heaven, and admire the sun in its majesty, beauty, and radiant
effulgence; and, lastly, when night vailed the earth in darkness,
they could behold the starry heavens, the changing moon, and the stars
rising and setting in the unvarying course ordained from eternity, they
would surely exclaim, “There are gods, and such great things must
be the work of their hands.”</p>

      <div class='line'>Rich, spacious, and well tilled. Plowers not few,</div>
      <div class='line'>There driving to and fro their sturdy teams,</div>
      <div class='line'>Labor’d the land; and oft as in their course</div>
      <div class='line'>They came to the field’s bourn, so oft a man</div>
      <div class='line'>Met them, who in their hands a goblet placed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Charged with delicious wine. They, turning, wrought</div>
      <div class='line'>Each his own furrow, and impatient seem’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To reach the border of the tilth, which black</div>
      <div class='line'>Appear’d behind them as a glebe new-turn’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though golden, sight to be admired by all!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There, too, he form’d the likeness of a field,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crowded with corn, in which the reapers toil’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Each with a sharp-tooth’d sickle in his hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>Along the furrow here the harvest fell</div>
      <div class='line'>In frequent handfuls, there they bound the sheaves.</div>
      <div class='line'>Three binders of the sheaves their sultry task</div>
      <div class='line'>All plied industrious, and behind them boys</div>
      <div class='line'>Attended, filling with the corn their arms,</div>
      <div class='line'>And offering still their bundles to be bound.</div>
      <div class='line'>Amid them, staff in hand, the master stood</div>
      <div class='line'>Silent exulting, while beneath an oak</div>

      <div class='line'>By poles of silver set in even rows.</div>
      <div class='line'>The trench he color’d sable, and around</div>

      <div class='line'>While in the midst a boy, on his shrill harp,</div>
      <div class='line'>Harmonious play’d; still as he struck the chord,</div>
      <div class='line'>Carolling to it with a slender voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>They smote the ground together, and with song</div>
      <div class='line'>And sprightly reed came dancing on behind.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There, too, a herd he fashion’d of tall beeves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Part gold, part tin; they, lowing, from the stalls</div>
      <div class='line'>Rush’d forth to pasture by a river-side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rapid, sonorous, fringed with whispering reeds.</div>
      <div class='line'>Four golden herdsmen drove the kine a-field,</div>
      <div class='line'>By nine swift dogs attended. Dreadful sprang</div>
      <div class='line'>Two lions forth, and of the foremost herd,</div>

      <div class='line'>The lions tore the hide of the huge prey,</div>

      <div class='line'>The herdsmen, troubling them in vain, their hounds</div>
      <div class='line'>Encouraged; but no tooth for lion’s flesh</div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c017'><em>October 19, 1797.</em></div>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>The valley of Collares affords me a source of perpetual amusement.
I have discovered a variety of paths which lead through chestnut copses
and orchards to irregular green spots, where self-sown bays and citronbushes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>hang wild over the rocky margin of a little river, and drop their
fruit and blossoms into the stream. You may ride for miles along the
banks of this delightful water, catching endless perspectives of flowery
thickets, between the stems of poplar and walnut. The scenery is truly
Elysian, and exactly such as poets assign for the resort of happy spirits.
The mossy fragments of rocks, grotesque pollards, and rustic bridges
you meet with at every step, recall Savoy and Switzerland to the imagination;
but the exotic cast of the vegetation, the vivid green of the
citron, the golden fruitage of the orange, the blossoming myrtle, and the
rich fragrance of a turf embroidered with the brightest-colored and most
aromatic flowers, allow me, without a stretch of fancy, to believe myself
in the garden of the Hesperides, and to expect the dragon under
every tree. I by no means like the thought of abandoning these smiling
regions, and have been twenty times on the point, this very day, of revoking
the orders I have given for my journey. Whatever objections I
may have had to Portugal seem to vanish since I have determined to
leave it; for such is the perversity of human nature, that objects appear
the most estimable precisely at the moment when we are going to leave
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was this morning a mild radiance in the sunbeams, and a balsamic
serenity in the air, which infused that voluptuous listlessness—that
desire of remaining imparadised in one delightful spot, which, in
classical fictions, was supposed to render those who had tasted of the
lotus, forgetful of friends and of every tie. My feelings were not dissimilar;
I loathed the idea of moving away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Though I had entered these beautiful orchards soon after sunrise, the
clocks of some distant conventual churches had chimed hour after hour,
before I could prevail upon myself to quit the spreading odoriferous baytrees
under which I had been lying. If shades so cool and fragrant invited
to repose, I must observe, that never were paths better calculated
to tempt the laziest of beings to a walk, than those that opened on all
sides, and are formed of a smooth, dry sand, bound firmly together,
composing a surface as hard as gravel. These level paths wind about
among a labyrinth of light, elegant fruit-trees: almond, plum, and
cherry, something like the groves of Tongo-Taboo, as represented in
Cook’s voyages; and to increase the resemblance, neat, clean fences and
low, open sheds, thatched with reeds, appear at intervals, breaking the
horizontal line of the perspective. I had now lingered and loitered away
pretty nearly the whole morning, and though, as far as scenery could
authorize and climate inspire, I might fancy myself an inhabitant of
Polynesia, I could not pretend to be sufficiently ethereal to exist without
nourishment. In plain English, I was extremely hungry. The pears,
quinces, and oranges, which dangled above my head, although fair to
the eye, were neither so juicy nor so gratifying to the palate, as might
have been expected from their promising appearance.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>Being considerably</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>and not recollecting by which clue of a path I could get out of it, I remained
at least half an hour deliberating which way to turn myself.
The sheds and inclosures I have mentioned were put together with care,
and even nicety, it is true, but seemed to have no other inhabitants
than flocks of bantams, strutting about and destroying the eggs and hopes
of many an insect family. These glistening fowls, like their brethren
described in Anson’s voyages, as ruminating the profound solitudes of the
island of Tinian, appeared to have no master. At length, just as I was
beginning to wish myself very heartily in a less romantic region, I heard
the loud, though not unmusical tones of a powerful female voice, echoing
through the arched green avenues; presently a stout, ruddy young peasant,
very picturesquely attired in brown and scarlet, came hoydening
along, driving a mule before her laden with two enormous panniers of
grapes. To ask for a share of this luxurious load, and to compliment the
fair driver, was instantaneous on my part—but to no purpose. I was
answered by a sly wink: “We all belong to Senhor José Dias, whose
coreal (farm-yard) is half a league distant. There, Senhor, if you follow
that road and don’t puzzle yourself by a straying to the right or
left, you will soon reach it, and the bailiff, I dare say, will be proud to
give you as many grapes as you please. Good-morning; happy days to
you! I must mind my business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Seating herself between the tantalizing panniers, she was gone in an
instant, and I had the good luck to arrive at the wicket of a rude, dry
well, winding up several bushy slopes in a wild, irregular manner. If
the outside of this inclosure was rough and unpromising, the interior
presented a most cheerful scene of rural opulence: droves of cows and
goats milking; ovens, out of which huge savory cakes of bread had just
been taken; ranges of bee-hives and long pillared sheds, entirely tapestried
with purple and yellow muscadine grapes half candied, which
were hung up to dry. A very good-natured, classical-looking <em>magister
pecorum</em>, followed by two well-disciplined, though savage-eyed dogs,
whom the least glance of their master prevented from barking, gave me
a hearty welcome, and with genuine hospitality not only allowed me the
free range of his domain, but set whatever it produced in the greatest
perfection before me. A contest took place between two or three curly-haired,
chubby-faced children, who should be first to bring me walnuts
fresh from the shell, bowls of milk, and cream cheeses, made after the
best of fashions, that of the province of Alemtejo.</p>
